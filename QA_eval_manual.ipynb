rs1815739), which\\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally significant.\\n</SENT 06_07>\\n<SENT 06_08>\\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\\nendurance outcome (based on competitor finish time) during\\nthe South Africa Éronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were observed in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls) between\\ngroups and when laboratory endurance performance indexes\\nwere evaluated.PPAR-/H9251(PPARA) rs4253778 is an intronic variant that is\\ninvolved in the regulation of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\\nlipid metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis (39).\\n</SENT 06_08>\\n<SENT 06_09>\\nThis\\nvariant was investigated in a multisport case-control study (2)\\n(n /H11005786 Russian athletes vs. 1,242 controls) stratified by\\nperformance (endurance, sprint, and mixed) in which endurance athletes had significantly higher frequency of the G allele\\nthan controls.Thesame polymorphism was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in Africadescended people but not in Caucasians (35).It is unknown\\nwhether ancestry-specific genetic effects (11) may also be\\nimportant in athletic performance.PPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation, glucose utilization, mitochondrial\\nbiogenesis, angiogenesis, and muscle fiber type (39), and\\nPPAR-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A;
