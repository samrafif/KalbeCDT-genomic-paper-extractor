First published\nDecember 31, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00780.2009.\u2014Athletic en-\ndurance performance is probably partly under genetic control, but\ngenetic association studies have yielded inconclusive results. The\nobjective of the present study was to evaluate the association of\npolymorphisms in eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with\nendurance performance in participants of the Olympus Marathon\nrunning race. We recruited 438 athletes who participated in the 2007\nand 2008 annual running events of the Olympus Marathon: a 43.8-km\nrace with an ascent from sea level to 2,690-m altitude and then a\ndescent to 300 m. Phenotypes of interest were thecompetitive event\ntime at the speci\ufb01c Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled,\nthe fastest reported timing ever achieved in an Olympus Marathon, and\nhow many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the previous year.\nEleven polymorphisms in/H92513-actinin ( ACTN3), AMP deaminase-1\n(AMPD1), bradykinin B 2 receptor (BDKRB2), /H92522-adrenergic receptor\n(ADRB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-/H9253coactiva-\ntor-1/H9251(PPARGC1A), PPAR-/H9251(PPARA), PPAR-/H9254(PPARD), and apo-\nliprotein E (APOE) were evaluated. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing\non the overall cohort of male athletes showed a signi\ufb01cant deviation for\nBDKRB2rs1799722 (P /H110050.018;P /H110050.006 when limited to 316 habitual\nmale runners) with an excess of the TT genotype. Across all athletes, no\nassociations showed nominal statistical signi\ufb01cance for any of the\nthree phenotypes, and the same was true when analyses were limited\nto men (n /H11005417). When limited to 316 male athletes who identi\ufb01ed\nrunning as their preferred sport, ADRB2 rs1042713 had nominally\nsigni\ufb01cant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for\nthe fastest time ever (P /H110050.01). The direction of effect was identical\nas previously postulated only for BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713, indicating consistency. BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance\nperformance among habitual runners and require further investigation.\ngenetics; endurance\nPHYSICAL FITNESS is a very complex phenotype in\ufb02uenced by\nnumerous genetic and environmental factors contributing to the\nobserved interindividual variation not only in the general\npopulation but also in trained athletes (24). Numerous studies\nhave been performed in the last decade to try to establish\nwhether speci\ufb01c genes with postulated functional roles in\nhuman physiology in\ufb02uence athletic performance and endur-\nance, and a growing number of candidate gene associations\nhave been proposed (5, 27). Studies have varied in sample size\nand type of population, and several proposed associations have\nnot been consistently replicated in independent investigations\nby different teams of investigators.\nMultiple genetic loci are likely to underlie the heritability of\nthe complex phenotype of athletic performance. Some aspects\nof this phenotype have high estimated heritability, for example,\nthe heritability of maximal O2 uptake (V\u02d9O2max)i s /H1101150% in\nboth the sedentary state and after training (3, 4). Even if\nheritability is less for other aspects of athletic performance,\neach genetic variant is likely to explain only a small fraction of\nthe genetic predisposition. Recently, Williams and Folland (44)\ncalculated the probability that exists for an individual to be in\npossession of any of the most optimal of the 23 selected\npolymorphisms related to athletic performance. Studies inves-\ntigating the collective in\ufb02uence of a number of genetic poly-\nmorphisms could possibly help unravel and thus possibly better\nexplain the inherent individual variations in athletic perfor-\nmance. In the present study, we studied participants in the\nOlympus Marathon, an athletic event that requires considerable\nendurance and for which there are large differences in perfor-\nmance among the participants. The optimal physiological phe-\nnotype of athletes competing in long-duration events probably\nentails an inherent genetic makeup conferring cardiovascular,\npulmonary, and skeletal competence to perform during such\nevents and ef\ufb01cient metabolism of available substrates to\nsustain the performance throughout the event\u2019s duration.\nWe evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\neight genes that have known functional roles, and we based our\nselection on previous gene association studies investigating\naspects of athletic endurance. In particular, the selected genes\nin our study have been previously associated with appropriate\nsubstrate metabolism as a source of energy during exercise, in the\ncardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise that would\nallow for a much ef\ufb01cient O2 uptake and transfer to the muscles\nfor utilization, and/or in muscle contractility suitable for the\npurposes of endurance performance. Moreover, the selected\npolymorphisms had been evaluated in the past in one or more\nstudies, where at least one of the studies had reported signi\ufb01-\ncant associations with endurance performance (5, 27).\nMETHODS\nCohort participants.We enrolled athletes participated in the annual\nOlympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece. We only\nenrolled athletes of self-veri\ufb01ed Greek ancestry to avoid confounding\ndata from population strati\ufb01cation. Athletes were approached at the\ncompetition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of\nthe research team. They were informed about the aim and purpose of\nthe study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in\nparticipating in the study. Written informed consent was obtained\nAddress for reprint requests and other correspondence: J. P. A.

Athletes \ufb01lled out a short questionnaire on\npersonal identi\ufb01ers; age, sex, and current height and weight; whether\nrunning was their preferred sport (and, if not, which sport was their\npreferred one); how many kilometers they had run per week in the last\nweek, month, and year before the competition; the highest altitude\nthey had ever reached; and the longest distance they had ever ran\nwithout stopping. A saliva sample was \ufb01nally collected for DNA\nanalysis. The data collection for the study occurred at the 2007 and\n2008 annual events. The study protocol was reviewed by the Univer-\nsity Hospital of Ioannina Scienti\ufb01c Committee, and ethical approval\nwas granted.\nRace course description. The race course length is 43.8 km. It\nentails a gradual ascent from the start line located a t 3 m above sea\nlevel, reaches a maximum altitude of 2,690 m, and then has a downhill\nroute to the \ufb01nish line at an altitude of 300 m. The race provides an\nexcellent event for assessing variability in endurance performance.\nThe winner usually completes the race in/H110115 h, but times of people\nthat have completed the race vary substantially and can exceed 14 h.\nGenotyping. Saliva samples (2 ml) were collected from all volun-\nteers using the Oragene DNA Self Collection Kits (DNA Genotek)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; the Oragene collection\ntube also contained 2 ml of stabilizing agent. All samples were\ncollected at the competition site in Greece and were then sent for\nanalysis at Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, The Nether-\nlands). Samples were processed using a PUREGENE DNA Puri\ufb01ca-\ntion kit (DNA Genotek\u2019s Oragene DNA Puri\ufb01cation protocol, DNA\nGenotec, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). For DNA isolation, 3 ml of the\nsaliva mixture were used, and 120 ml of Oragene puri\ufb01er were added.\nAfter a 10-min incubation on ice, the vial was spun down, and the\npellet was discarded. Subsequently, an equal volume of ethanol was\nadded to precipitate the DNA. After a 10-min incubation at room\ntemperature, the vial was spun down, the supernatant was discarded,\nand the pellet was air dried. The DNA pellet was then dissolved in 300\nml MilliQ water.\nPolymorphisms under study. The selected genes, their respective\nSNP identi\ufb01cation numbers, and the implicated function of these\ngenes are shown in Table 1. For all genes under study, one variant has\nbeen investigated for associations with endurance performance and\nrelated phenotypes except for the peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor (PPAR)-/H9254gene ( PPARD), where three variants have been\nproposed to affect endurance. For all SNPs, Taqman assays were\ngenerated and applied according to the manufacturers\u2019s speci\ufb01cations.\nResults were analyzed with the ABI Taqman 7900HT using sequence\ndetection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA). To con\ufb01rm the accuracy of the genotyping results, 5% of the\nrandomly selected samples were regenotyped with the same method.\nNo inconsistencies were observed. All primers and probes used in the\npresent study are available on request.\nPhenotypes. We de\ufb01ned a priori the following phenotypes: 1) the\nevent completion time at the speci\ufb01c Olympus Marathon where the\nathlete was enrolled in the study,2) the fastest reported event\ncompletion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race, and\n3) how many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 mo\nbefore enrollment in the study.\nFor athletes who ran both years and were included in our sample\nsize, we used for the time to \ufb01nish the time in the year during which\nthey were \ufb01rst enrolled. However, if they only completed one of the\ntwo races, then we used the time when they completed the race. All\nathletes that exceeded the time limit for \ufb01nishing the race set by the\norganizing committee (12 h in 2007 and 10 h in 2008) were personally\ncontacted to provide a self-reported time \ufb01nish, since the of\ufb01cial time\nwas not available.\nStatistical analyses.Genotypes for each tested polymorphism were\ntested for compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\nlaw using an exact test. Deviations from HWE may be due to different\nreasons (31), but, in this design, they may also be used as a crude test\nof association (36), since the analyzed cohort is a selected population\nTable 1.

    "with selection based on a phenotype (participation in a very demand-\ning endurance event) that re\ufb02ects overall endurance performance.\nThe main association analyses were performed using model-free\nANOVA and allele-based linear regression models for continuous\ntraits including only males. The major allele was considered as a\nreference. For the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), the \u03b54/\u03b54 versus\n\u03b54/other versus other/other genotypes were considered for the\nANOVA. Also, a contrast of \u03b52 versus other alleles was considered .\nThe analysis of the event completion time at the speci\ufb01c Olympus\nMarathon was adjusted for age and year of the race (to allow for\ndifferent event completion times due to any different weather condi-\ntions in different years). The best time ever achieved in the Olympus\nMarathon and the kilometers per week analysis were adjusted for age\nonly. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to evaluate if the phenotypes\nwere normally distributed. Given that we observed signi\ufb01cant devia-\ntions from normality, a natural logarithm transformation was per-\nformed on all three phenotypes. For signi\ufb01cant associations, a pair-\nwise interaction analysis was performed.\nWe performed additional secondary analyses: a sex-strati\ufb01ed anal-\nysis where both men and women were considered and an analysis\nwhere we considered only male athletes who stated in the enrollment\nquestionnaire that running was their preferred sport. Moreover, in the\nanalysis of the event completion time at the speci\ufb01c Olympus Mara-\nthon, whenever an athlete did not complete the race the athlete was\nexcluded from the main analysis; however, we also performed a\nsensitivity analysis where the timing of such dropout athletes was\nimputed by the time of the slowest athlete \ufb01nishing the race. Finally,\nin another analysis, we tested if a speci\ufb01c variant affected the\nperformance of an athlete by testing athletes that \ufb01nished the race\nversus athletes who did not complete the event using a per-allele\nmodel.\nOur study had 80% power to detect at /H9251/H110050.05 associations where\nthe per-allele effect would be 1/10th the magnitude of the standard\ndeviation of the phenotype of interest in the population, when the\nminor allele frequency would be 10%.\nAssociations that reach formal statistical signi\ufb01cance at P /H110210.05\ndo not necessarily mean that they are true. One may consider an\napproach to correct theP values for eight genes being evaluated and\nclaim signi\ufb01cance for P /H110210.05/8 /H110050.006 or, if all variants are\nconsidered independent, for P /H110210.05/11 /H110050.0045. However, such a\ncorrection would be debatable given that these gene variants have\nalready been proposed and have at least one other study suggesting\nthat they may be important. To avoid this controversy, we present\ninferences based on an alternative, Bayesian approach. Speci\ufb01cally,\nwe estimated the Bayes factors according to a spike and smear model\n(10), if the mean effect of true associations might be 0.04 in the log\nscale (corresponding to a 9.6% difference in performance per allele,\ne.g., completing the marathon in 456 vs. 500 min). The inverse of\nthe Bayes factor tells how many fold the odds of an association to be\ntrue increase based on the results of the study compared with what one\nthought before the study. Thus, if the odds of an association to be true\nwere 1:9 [1/(1 /H110019) /H110051/10 /H1100510% likely to be true] before the study\nand the Bayes factor from the study data is 0.2 (inverse /H110051/0.2 /H110055),\nthen the odds of the association to be true become 5:9 [5/(5 /H110019) /H11005\n5/14 /H1100536% likely to be true]. Given that different investigators may\nhave different beliefs, we also present credibility estimates (the\nlikelihood of an association being true) for prior evidence of 0.1 (with\na 1:10 prior chance of the association being true), 0.001 (a more\nconservative, sceptical approach, with a 1:1,000 chance of the asso-\nciation being true), and 0.000001 (a most sceptical approach, with a 1\nin a million chance of the association being true, e.g., if the prior\nevidence mostly suggests that the association would have an effect in\nthe opposite direction than what is seen in the present study).\nAll analyses were performed with STATA (version 10.0, College\nStation, TX). P values were two tailed. Reporting of the study data\nfollows STREGA guidelines (17).\nRESULTS\nCohort characteristics.A total of 438 athletes (417 men and\n21 women) volunteered for the study during the 2 yr. Two\nhundred sixty-eight athletes enrolled in 2007 and 229 athletes\ncompleted the race; in 2008, 170 athletes enrolled and 156\nathletes \ufb01nished the race. Nine athletes who did not \ufb01nish the\nrace in the year of enrolment (2007) completed the race in\n2008. Hence, there were 44 athletes that did not ever \ufb01nish the\nOlympus marathon. Population characteristics are shown in\nTable 2. Three hundred thirty-three athletes (76%) stated that\ntheir preferred sport was running, whereas the other partici-\npants mentioned climbing (n /H1100518), cycling (n /H1100516), or other\nsports (n /H1100572). The training of athletes that do not compete in\nrunning may not be focused in the development of an endur-\nance phenotype. Runners completed the race in faster times\nthan the other group of athletes; however, this difference was\nnot statistically different. Runners versus other athletes had a\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher number of kilometers run per week in the\nprevious year (mean: 56.4 vs. 37.2,P /H110210.0001) and previous\nmonth (mean: 63.4 vs. 46.8, P /H110210.0001) but did not differ in\nage, sex, weight, and height.\nDistribution of alleles and genotypes.The frequencies of the\npolymorphisms are shown in Table 1. The undetermined ge-\nnotypes were 2% or less for all polymorphisms.\nHWE analyses. With one exception, the distribution of\ngenotypes for all polymorphisms did not deviate signi\ufb01cantly\nfrom HWE. Speci\ufb01cally, bradykinin B2 receptor ( BDKRB2)\nrs1799722 deviated from the equilibrium (CC:n /H11005162, CT:n /H11005\n173, and TT: n /H1100576, exact P value /H110050.018) for male athletes\nTable 2.

The deviation was\nalso statistically signi\ufb01cant when we analyzed men that stated\nthat running was their preferred sport (CC:n /H11005127, CT: n /H11005\n125, TT: n /H1100559, exact P value /H110050.006) as well as all (both\nmale and female) athletes who stated that running was their\npreferred sport (CC:n /H11005133, CT: n /H11005132, TT: n /H1100563, exact\nP value /H110050.005), always with an excess of the TT genotype.\nHWE did not deviate signi\ufb01cantly among athletes that did not\ncomplete the race.\nAssociation analyses.When 417 male athletes were consid-\nered, there were generally formally no statistically signi\ufb01cant\n\ufb01ndings observed for the polymorphisms under study regard-\nless of whether a model-free ANOVA or an allele-based model\nwas used, as shown in Table 3. The results were largely\nunaltered when both men and women were considered and\nwhen the missing values were imputed with the slowest time\nreported (not shown).\nWhen we performed the analysis with male athletes that\nstated that running was their preferred sport of interest (Table 4),\nan association in one polymorphism [/H92522-adrenergic receptor\n(ADRB2) rs1042713] reached nominal statistical signi\ufb01cance,\nwith faster times for the A allele for the fastest time ever ( P /H11005\n0.01). For the speci\ufb01c association, we performed a sensitivity\nanalysis where the training volume (expressed as kilometers per\nweek the athlete ran during the 12 mo before enrollment in the study)\nwas used as a covariate. The association remained signi\ufb01cant for\nrs1042713 (P /H110050.035). Also, a nominal signi\ufb01cantP value of 0.04\nwas found for AMP deaminase-1 (AMPD1) rs17602729 for the\nfastest time ever using model-free ANOVA (Table 4).\nThese two variants ( AMPD1 rs17602729 and ADRB2\nrs1042713) reached statistical signi\ufb01cance, both for the time at\nthe speci\ufb01c event and for the fastest time ever, and with similar\nper-allele effects for the two phenotypes when we performed\nan analysis including both men and women. ForAMPD1\nrs17602729, the P values were 0.021 and 0.03 for event\ncompletion time and for the fastest time ever, respectively.

    "In the per-allele models, for the analysis including only male\nrunners, the estimated Bayes factor was 0.22 for ADRB2\nrs1042713 for the fastest time ever achieved. When the anal-\nysis of the runners included both sexes, the estimated Bayes\nfactors were 0.27 and 0.24 for the time in the speci\ufb01c event and\n0.34 and 0.06 for the fastest time ever achieved forAMPD1\nrs17602729 and ADRB2 rs1042713, respectively. These corre-\nspond, respectively, to 5-, 4-, 4-, 3-, and 16-fold increases in\nthe odds that the association is true compared with the prior\nbelief before the study. For a prior credibility of 10% (1:10\nlikely to be true), the credibility of the associations was 31%\nfor the fastest time ever achieved in the analysis of male\nrunners. For all runners, the credibility was 27% and 29% for\nthe time in the speci\ufb01c event and 23% and 62% for the fastest\ntime ever achieved for the two polymorphisms, respectively.\nFor a prior credibility of 1:1,000 or 1:1,000,000, the credibility\nof the associations would be negligible (/H110210.1% for all four\nanalyses).\nDISCUSSION\nWe investigated 11 polymorphisms in 8 muscle- and/or\nmetabolism-related genes in a large group of athletes that\ncompeted in a special athletic event that is highly demanding\nfor endurance. In this selected cohort, BDKRB2 rs1799722\ndeviated signi\ufb01cantly from HWE with an excess of TT indi-\nviduals, suggesting that this genotype may be associated with\nendurance performance in general. Moreover, we found asso-\nciations with nominal statistical signi\ufb01cance forADRB2\nrs1042713 for the best time ever among male athletes where\nrunning is their preferred sport and associations forAMPD1\nrs17602729 and ADRB2 rs1042713 for the time of the speci\ufb01c\nevent and best time ever among all (both male and female)\nrunners. Given that these genes and variants have clear func-\ntional roles and have also been proposed as potentially impor-\ntant by previous studies, modest signals should not be dis-\nmissed, if they also agree with other prior evidence.\nOur \ufb01ndings are in agreement with prior evidence for\nADRB2 rs1042713 (Arg16Gly). ADRB2 rs1042713 encodes\nthe /H92522-adrenergic receptor that is primarily responsible for\nincreases in bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodi-\nlation, all of which have direct implications on cardiovascular\nand pulmonary responses to exercise (36).

ARDB2 regulates the cardiopulmonary re-\nsponse to exercise (36), and this polymorphism has been\ninvestigated in many phenotypes, with some evidence oflower\nmean arterial blood pressure at rest, during and after exercise for\nArg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in\npatients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased ther-\nmogenic responses to/H92522-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\nAMPD1 (rs17602729), which functions in skeletal muscle\nmetabolism (salvage of adenine nucleotides) and is involved in\nthe regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise\n(29), was evaluated in a case-control study (n /H11005104 endurance\nathletes vs. 100 controls). The minor (A) allele was actually\nsigni\ufb01cantly less common in endurance athletes than in con-\ntrols, but endurance indexes such as V\u02d9O2max, ventilatory thresh-\nold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the\nminor allele (29). Furthermore,AMPD1 rs17602729 was eval-\nuated in a study assessing physiological responses in 503\nindividuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime, and the minor\nallele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to\nendurance (28). Therefore, our results are in the opposite\ndirection for this polymorphism than what prior studies had\nsuggested. Discrepancies may be due to different study design,\nsetting, types of athletes, and phenotype de\ufb01nitions, but most\nlikely they simply represent false positives in opposite direc-\ntions, and this polymorphism is not credibly associated with\nendurance performance. Incidentally, there is a case report (19)\non a world-class athlete with exceptionally favorable labora-\ntory indexes for endurance performance (V\u02d9O2max) despite car -\nrying the A allele (19), which further documents that these\ngenetic effects, even if present, are subtle and do not doom\none\u2019s athletic performance.\nVariation at the BDKRB2 (rs1799722) gene locus, which\nencodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the\nincrease of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise\n(34), has also been associated with endurance performance in\nprevious studies. In one study (43), athletes (n /H1100581) compet-\ning in longer distance events had a signi\ufb01cantly higher fre-\nquency of the/H110029 allele, a 9-bp insertion/deletion polymor-\nphism in exon 1. In a study of 453 athletes who completed the\nSouth Africa Ironman Triathlon, the athletes had a signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher frequency of the/H110029//H110029 genotype compared with the\ncontrols (n /H11005203) (34). In that same study (34), the /H110029 allele\nwas not signi\ufb01cantly different in three groups of athletes who\ncompleted the event in fast, medium, and slow times (34). The\n/H110029 allele has been demonstrated to result in increased tran-\nscription rates of the gene (6). In our study, we focused only on\nSNPs rather than insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and we\ninstead genotyped the promoter variant rs1799722 (also known\nas/H1100258C/T), which is also known to have a functional impact\non the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele\nin luciferase experiments (15). We found results consistent\nwith previous evidence: the high transcription allele was over-\nrepresented in this group of endurance athletes and, even more\nso, among those who are habitual runners. The same promoter\nvariant has also been associated with hypertension, left ven-\ntricular hypertrophy, and barore\ufb02ex sensitivity (7, 22).\nAll of the other polymorphisms that showed no nominally\nsigni\ufb01cant signals in our study have been examined in the past\nin at least one other study, but the evidence was often incon-\nclusive or may be stronger for associations with phenotypes\nthat have only indirect bearing on athletic endurance perfor-\nmance. Moreover, we only examined speci\ufb01c polymorphisms\nfor each one of these genes, so we cannot exclude that other\nvariants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic\nperformance in particular populations. Finally, our study was\npowered to detect modest effects, but subtle effects for variants\nwith minor allele frequencies/H1102110% may have been missed.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, in /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally signi\ufb01cant.\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\nendurance outcome (based on competitor \ufb01nish time) during\nthe South Africa \u00c9ronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were ob-\nserved in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls) between\ngroups and when laboratory endurance performance indexes\nwere evaluated.\nPPAR-/H9251(PPARA) rs4253778 is an intronic variant that is\ninvolved in the regulation of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\nlipid metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis (39). This\nvariant was investigated in a multisport case-control study (2)\n(n /H11005786 Russian athletes vs. 1,242 controls) strati\ufb01ed by\nperformance (endurance, sprint, and mixed) in which endur-\nance athletes had signi\ufb01cantly higher frequency of the G allele\nthan controls. Thesame polymorphism was found to be associ-\nated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in Africa-\ndescended people but not in Caucasians (35). It is unknown\nwhether ancestry-speci\ufb01c genetic effects (11) may also be\nimportant in athletic performance.\nPPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation, glucose utilization, mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, angiogenesis, and muscle \ufb01ber type (39), and\nPPAR-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A; rs8192678) regulates\ngenes involved in energy metabolism and is associated with\nmitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle \ufb01ber type con-\nversion (20). Both genes seem to have independent effects on\nthe effectiveness of aerobic exercise training to increase aero-\nbic physical \ufb01tness and insulin sensitivity (39). Furthermore, a\nwhole body MRI study (38) found differential changes after\nlifestyle intervention in overall adiposity, hepatic fat storage,\nand relative muscle mass for the rs1053049, rs6902123, and\nrs2267668 variants ofPPARD (38). Moreover, in a multisport\ncase-control study (1) ( n /H110051,256 athletes vs. 610 controls),\nPPARD allelic differences were seen in endurance athletes but\nnot in controls (1), and another case-control study (20) found\nthat the minor allele ofPPARGC1A rs8192678 was signi\ufb01-\ncantly more common in un\ufb01t controls ( n /H11005100) than in\nendurance athletes ( n /H11005104). However, it is unclear whether\nsuch associations would result also in noticeable differences in\nperformance among endurance athletes besides differentiating\nathletes from controls. Similarly, for apolipoprotein E (APOE;\nrs7412 and rs429358), which facilitates triglyceride clearance\nby mediating lipoprotein binding to hepatic receptors, thus\ncontributing to the variability in individual response to exercise\ntraining (41), the\u03b54 allele in previous studies (8, 41) was found\nto be associated with better physiological responses after ex-\n572 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON RUNNERS\nJ Appl Physiol\u007f VOL 108 \u007f MARCH 2010 \u007f www.jap.org\nDownloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jappl (110.138.091.074) on January 26, 2023.\n",

    "ercise training, but this may not necessarily translate to better\nendurance performance. In all, more extensive replication\nwould be essential (10, 15) before making claims that any of\nthese variants have a substantial effect speci\ufb01cally on endur-\nance performance.\nFurthermore, three case-control studies (30, 32, 23) exam-\nined the representation in athletes and controls of seven poly-\nmorphisms, three of which (ACTN3 rs1815739, AMPD1\nrs17602729, and PPARGC1A rs8192678) were also investi-\ngated in our study. In the \ufb01rst study (3) ( n /H1100546 endurance\nathletes vs. 123 controls), a point was given for each \u201cfavorable\nallele,\u201d and the overall mean total score was higher in athletes\nthan in controls. The second study (32) (n /H1100539 world-level\nathletes vs. 15 national-level athletes) found no differences in\ngenetic pro\ufb01les between the two groups of athletes. The third\nstudy (23) compared many groups (n /H1100550 professional cy-\nclists vs. 52 Olympic-level runners vs. 39 world-level rowers\nvs. 123 controls), and no signi\ufb01cant differences among the\ngroups were found. Given the relatively limited sample size, it\nis dif\ufb01cult to draw conclusive inferences.\nSome limitations should be discussed. We used a cohort\ndesign and did not make a comparison against matched non-\nathlete controls from the general population. Therefore, we\nperformed two analyses for association: a \ufb01rst crude screening\nbased on the Hardy-Weinberg test and another based on asso-\nciation for continuous outcomes of endurance performance\nwithin the cohort of athletes. Hardy-Weinberg testing has low\npower as an association test, and subtle associations may have\nbeen missed in this screening. The analysis of comparative\nperformance is based on a continuous outcome, and it has good\npower to detect modest differences, but most genetic effects for\ncommon variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude\n(13), andsuch effects could still have been missed. Con-\nversely, nominally signi\ufb01cant associations should be inter-\npreted with caution since they may still represent false\npositives, and we encourage further replication of our \ufb01nd-\nings in additional studies and settings(14). Third, genes and\npolymorphisms were selected based on considerable prior\nknowledge on the function of the proteins encoded by these\ngenes and also some prior epidemiological evidence. With the\nadvent of high-throughput genotyping, the \ufb01eld of athletic\nperformance should also consider the conduct of agnostic\ngenome-wide association studies (21), although for variants\nemerging from such studies it is often dif\ufb01cult to establish their\nphysiological functional role (10).\nOverall, human physical performance is a multifactorial phe-\nnotype in which numerous genetic and environmental factors have\njoint effects.Athletic performance is very much in\ufb02uenced by\ntraining programmes and opportunities, residing altitude, re-\ncovery, nutrition, sporting equipment, and psychological fac-\ntors during competition. Some of these factors may also be\nreciprocally determined by genetic input to some extent, e.g.,\nthe propensity to exercise may also be a genetic trait (38). In\nour study, we also tried to perform analyses limited to athletes\nthat had a strong preference for running, but there was still\ndiversity in some other exposures, e.g., the amount of training\nfor these athletes. Dissecting the complex effects on athletic\nexcellence will require large-scale studies with meticulous\nmeasurements and replication of proposed associations in di-\nverse datasets.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank F.

We investigated whether physical activity modulates the\neffect ofFTO rs9939609 on obesity in Korean population.\nMethods: The study analyzed the correlation between physical activity and\nobesity in 8840 individuals representing the Korea Association Resource\n(KARE). The association between obesity-related traits and single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed using linear regression models. Physical\nactivity was defined as 3 hours or more of daily intense activity.\nResults: Participants carrying rs9939609 (AT+AA) genotypes showed higher\nBMI compared with those carrying the wild-type (TT) homozygote. The\nhighest significant association was observed between obesity-related traits\n(\u00df = .334,P value = 1.76\u00d7 10\u22126). FTO rs9939609 (AT+AA) increased the risk\nof obesity (OR = 1.42, CI [1.13-1.79]), which was correlated with BMI correla-\ntions. However, active exercise by subjects carrying the same genotype reduced\nthe risk of obesity by nearly 2-fold (OR = 0.62, CI [0.25-0.84]). In contrast, TT\ngenotype was not statistically significant in reducing the risk of obesity in the\nactive exercise group.\nConclusions: Our results support a previous finding correlating FTO and\nobesity-related traits and suggest that the interaction with genetic variation\nand physical activity is an important risk factor for obesity.\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the\nprevalence of obesity worldwide has nearly tripled since\n1975, and more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and\nover (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight in\n2016. According to the key facts reported by WHO, most\nof the world's population lives in countries where over-\nweight and obesity kill more people than underweight\n(World Health Organization, 2018). Obesity and\noverweight are attributed to an increase in physical inac-\ntivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many\nforms of work, changing modes of transportation, and\nincreasing urbanization. Obesity is becoming a global\npublic health concern as a result of low physical activity\nand genetic predisposition in individuals of all ages and\nethnic groups, as it contributes to the increasing burden\nof cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Kim\net al., 2016; Ogden et al., 2006).\nGenetic variants of the FTO (fat mass and obesity\nassociated) gene, located on chromosome 16q12.2, are\ncorrelated with obesity and higher body mass indexHye-Won Cho and Hyun-Seok Jin contributed equally to this study.\nReceived: 12 March 2020 Revised: 29 June 2020 Accepted: 29 July 2020\nDOI: 10.1002/ajhb.23489\nAm J Hum Biol.2020;e23489. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajhb \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC 1o f1 0\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23489\n\n\n(BMI) in humans (Cornes et al., 2009; Frayling\net al., 2007; Koike, Richards, Wong, & Hardy, 2018;\nLoos & Yeo, 2014). Heritability estimates for obesity-\nrelated traits indicate that a substantial proportion of\nphenotypic variation still needs to be explained\n(O'Rahilly & Farooqi, 2008). It is proposed that the inter-\naction between FTO gene and lifestyle factors may con-\ntribute to the variability of those traits, since many\nstudies have shown controversial results or negligible\ninteractive effects.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a link between\nFTO and higher BMI in humans. Individuals with first\nintron rs9939609 FTO obesity-risk allele (homozy-\ngous = AA and heterozygous = AT) were found to\nexhibit higher BMI than those with wild-type alleles\n(TT) (Qi et al., 2014; Saber-Ayad et al., 2019). Recent\nstudies reported an interaction betweenFTO genotypes,\nphysical inactivity, and BMI (Leonska-Duniec\net al., 2018; Liaw, Liaw, & Lan, 2019). Higher levels of\nphysical activity reduced the likelihood of being over-\nweight or obese (Bernstein, Costanza, & Morabia, 2004;\nKing et al., 2001; Payne, Cahill, Sun, Loredo-Osti, &\nAbarin, 2014; Yoshioka et al., 2005). However, none of\nthese studies considered the effect of genetic factors as\nmodifiers. Physical activity has been thought to exacer-\nbate the effect of theFTO gene (Andreasen et al., 2008).\nThe effect of genetic susceptibility on obesity caused by\nFTO variants can actually be attenuated by increased\nphysical activity (Vimaleswaran et al., 2009).\nA replication study is essential to establish the\nreported genetic association, especially among\npopulations of different ethnic backgrounds. However,\nstudies involving Oceanic population (Ohashi\net al., 2007), African Americans (Hinney et al., 2007),\nHan Chinese (Li et al., 2008), and Japanese (Horikoshi\net al., 2007) failed to detect the association between previ-\nously reported SNPs and obesity or obesity-related traits\n(Chang et al., 2008). Although the limited sample size\nand power of these studies is the most likely reason for\nthe lack of association, evidence showed that otherFTO\nSNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs9939609\nmay be causative variants in non-European populations\n(Grant et al., 2008). Taken together, the significant role\nplayed by physical activity in the relation betweenFTO\ngenetic variant and obesity across different cultures or\nethnicities needs to be established. AlthoughFTO geno-\ntypes have been reported to interact with physical activity\nand correlate with BMI (Lee et al., 2010), the direct effect\nof the risk alleles in theFTO gene and physical activity\non obesity have yet to be reported in the Korean\npopulation.\nAlthough physical activity has been shown to facili-\ntate weight loss and weight maintenance in obese\nsubjects, a tremendous interindividual variation exists\n(Perusse et al., 2000). It is unknown whether lifestyle fac-\ntors, such as physical activity, attenuate obesity in indi-\nviduals with an underlyingFTO genetic predisposition.\nThus, the objective of this study was to further\nexplore the relationships between physical activity,FTO\nSNPs, and obesity within a Korean population. We\nbelieve that our results pertaining to obesity and physical\nactivity are important and widely applicable to the obe-\nsity health promotion program.\n2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 | Subjects\nA total of 8840 subjects aged 40 to 69 years were recruited\nfrom the Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean\nGenome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), which repre-\nsent rural and urban communities in Korea, respectively.\nThe baseline survey of the KoGES involved a total of\n10 038 adults from 2001 to 2002, surveyed biannually.\nThe Korea Association Resource (KARE) project facili-\ntated the availability of DNA in the large-scale genome-\nwide analysis of 10 004 participants, following which\n8840 genotypes were released into the public domain\n(Lee et al., 2010). A detailed analysis of Ansung and\nAnsan cohorts has been published previously (Cho\net al., 2007). The participant survey involved not only\ntheir parents' health history and anthropometric data\nsuch as height, weight, and waist and hip circumference,\nbut also education and income, physical activity, and die-\ntary intake. We categorized the participants as nonobese\n(18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (30 kg/m2 \u2264 BMI). We\nfollowed the WHO cutoffs to delineate obesity (BMI of\n25.0-29.99 for overweight [preobesity] and\u226530.0 for obe-\nsity) (World Health Organization, 2000). The genetic\ninformation used in this study was distributed by the\nHuman Resources Bank of Korea Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (KBN-2017-046) and analyzed\nafter approval of the research ethics committee of the\nKorea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and Hoeso\nUniversity (1041231170418-HR-056-02). Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.\n2.2 | Anthropometry and physical\nactivity\nHeight, weight, and circumference of waist and hips were\nmeasured by qualified medical staff, and BMI (weight (kg)/\nheight (m2)) and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR = waist mea-\nsurement (cm)/hip measurement (cm)) were calculated.\n2o f1 0 CHO ET AL.\n",

    "Body fat percentage (BFP) and abdominal fat percentage\n(AbFP) were measured via tetrapolar bioelectrical imped-\nance analysis (Inbody 3.0; Biospace, Seoul, Korea). Obesity\n(case) was defined by BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 and non-\nobesity (control) was defined by BMI 18.5 kg/m2 or higher,\nbut less than 25 kg/m2. To assess the index of physical activ-\nity, questionnaires were administered to subjects to deter-\nmine the number of hours per day the adult participated in\nintense activity (athletic sports, hiking, running, tree felling,\nforestry, mining industry, and farming). According to the\nlevel of activity, we classified subjects into two groups: inac-\ntive (<0.5 hour per day of intense activity) and active\n(\u22653 hours per day of intense activity). In addition, by apply-\ning standardized protocols throughout the entire process of\ninvestigation, in-depth data quality control and measure-\nment were achieved. Through this systematic and standard-\nized protocol, we confirmed the validity and reliability of\nthe assessment in terms of physical activity measures.\n2.3 | Genotyping\nGenomic DNA isolated from participants' whole blood\nwas genotyped with Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human\nSNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Subjects\nwith a genotyping accuracy less than 98%, high missing\ngenotype call rates greater than 4%, heterozygosity\ngreater than 30%, or gender mismatch were excluded.\nThe Affymetrix 500K arrays contain 87 SNPs within the\nregion of FTO gene. We selected and analyzed only\nrs9939609, which is well-known and had the lowest\nPvalue in all of BMI, BFP, and AbFP. The location of\nSNPs on the chromosome is based on National Center for\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) human genome build\n36 (hg18). The intragenotypic variations of rs9939609 in\nall outcome measures were analyzed using the dominant\nmodel (A allele carriers (AA/AT; n = 151, 1927 respec-\ntively) vs homozygous genotype (TT; n = 6751).\n2.4 | Statistical analysis\nIn most statistical analysis, the PLINK version 1.07\n(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu//C24purcell/plink) and the\nPASW Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL)\nwere used. Logistic regression analysis was used to corre-\nlate the genetic variation between obesity and non-\nobesity, based on the dominant genetic model for the\nestimation of odd ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval\n[CI]), in which area, age, and gender were controlled as\ncovariates. The significance level of the analytical value\nwas based on 0.05 or less. LocusZoom (http://locuszoom.\norg/) was used to determine the correlation between\nresults and recombination rate. HaploReg database\n(https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/\nhaploreg.php) was also used to identify the potential\nfunctional effects of the associated SNPs.\n3 | RESULTS\n3.1 | Participant characteristics\nThe average value of body measurements obtained by\ncase-control analysis is shown in Table 1. Finally, 8840\nparticipants were divided into obese (case) and nonobese\n(control) categories: 441 (4.98%) were obese group and\n4888 (55.2%) were nonobese group. As shown in Table 1,\nBMI, an indicative marker of obesity, differed among the\ncase-control groups and increased in the obese group.\nThe mean value of BMI in the obese group was 9.15 kg/\nm2 higher than in the nonobese group. The mean values\nof waist and hip circumference of the obese group were\nhigher than in the nonobese group and were 18.41 and\n12.92, respectively. Finally, the WHR of the obese group\nwas 0.09-fold higher than that of the nonobese group.\n3.2 | FTO variants and anthropometric\nand biochemical phenotypes\nAmong the indicators related to obesity, we selected BMI,\nBFP, AbFP, and WHR to analyze the association with\nFTO genetic variation. Twelve SNPs were associated with\nBMI, 8 SNPs with BFP, and 12 SNPs with AbFP (data not\nshown). The BMI, BFP, and AbFP showed the lowest\nP values in rs9939609, rs7193144, and rs9940128 (Table 2).\nAlso, the parameters BMI, BFP, and AbFP were signifi-\ncantly associated with theFTO rs9939609 genotype\n(1.76 \u00d7 10\u22126,1 . 7 7\u00d7 10\u22124, and 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22125, respectively).\nHowever, no association was found between WHR and\nFTOrs9939609, rs7193144, and rs9940128 genotypes.\n3.3 | Interaction of theFTO variant\nrs9939609 and physical activity with obesity\nThe genotypes of rs9939609 have varying effects on the\nimpact of exercise. In the dominant model, the associa-\ntion with exercise was highly significant (P value = .012).\nAmong A carriers, the risk of obesity among individuals\nwho exercised (OR = 0.62) was approximately more than\n2-fold lower than in those who did not exercise\n(OR = 1.42), suggesting that the interaction with geno-\ntype and exercise reduced the risk (Figure 1). However,\nthere was no statistically significant association between\nCHO ET AL. 3o f1 0\n\n\nindividuals carrying homozygous genotype of major\nalleles and exercise (OR = 0.87, CI [0.62-1.28],\nPvalue = 0.446), although exercise showed a tendency\ntoward a lower odds ratio. It also demonstrated a signifi-\ncant association with sex, which was one of the covari-\nants (Table S1, Supporting Information). The association\nbetween sex and obesity was apparent in both minor\nallele carriers (AA, AT) and the homozygous major allele\ngroup (TT) (P value = 0.001, 0, respectively). In the bar\ngraph (Figure 1), the A allele groups associated with exer-\ncise were associated with a reduced risk of obesity com-\npared with those carrying the A alleles without exposure\nto exercise. In addition, the probability of reduced risk of\nobesity was greater than the probability of reduced risk of\nobesity among subjects carrying TT genotype and\nexposed to exercise (Figure 1).

    "significance of the interactive effect between FTO\nrs9939609 and physical activity, linear regression analysis\nwas performed (Table S2). It was confirmed that exercise\nstatus controls the effect of minor allele carriers (AA, AT)\non obesity. TheR2 value was 0.001 (0.1%) in stage 1 and\n0.002 (0.2%) in stage 2, but increased to 0.893 (89.2%) in\nstage 3. According to the significance probability, it was\nfound to be less than 0.001, indicating that there is an\nadjustment effect (Table S2). These results indicate that\nthe effect of exercise was significantly associated with the\nFTO rs9939609 genotype in Korean adults.\n3.4 | Recombination rate of SNPs near\nthe FTO gene loci and functional\nannotation using HaploReg\nWe used the LocusZoom andHaploReg programs to deter-\nmine the recombination rates of SNPs and functional\nannotation of the FTO genetic variation. Eight SNPs\nshowed a high recombination rate near theFTO gene in\nLocusZoom (Figure 2). Among these, the SNP most closely\nrelated to BMI was rs9939609 (P value = 1.76 \u00d7 10\u22126).\nThese results suggest that in KARE, regardless of\nrs9939609 allele, rs9926289 (D0 =1 , r2 = 1), rs8050136\n(D0 =0 . 9 9 ,r2 = 0.99), rs7193144 (D0 =0 . 9 9 ,r2 =0 . 9 8 ) ,a n d\nrs1121980 (D0 =0 . 9 9 ,r2 = 0.88) define a haplotype that is\nassociated with increased BMI. To identify the potential\nrole of the associated SNP (rs9939609) inFTO gene, we\nscanned the SNP site using the HaploReg database.\nUsing HaploReg, we identified 91 genetic variants\ntagged by rs9939609 variant withr2 \u2265 0.8. These\n91 genetic variants are located around the FTO.T h e\nmost significantly associated rs9939609 site inFTO gene\nwas predicted to change the motif for Nanog and Pou5f1\ntranscription factor binding site in Table 3. Further-\nmore, the SNP site (rs9939609) was also associated with\nhistones marks associated with enhancers in breast can-\ncer loci (HaploReg v 4.1).\n4 | DISCUSSION\nEarly detection risk factors are important for the preven-\ntion of childhood obesity and its complications, especially\ngiven the social and habitual conditions associated with\nthe increased prevalence of obesity.

A growing number of stud-\nies have shown that the influence of theFTO gene on\nobesity may be modified by lifestyle factors such as diet\nand physical activity. Polymorphisms of the FTO gene\nare the only genetic variants that have been associated\nwith obesity in populations of European ancestry (Dina\net al., 2007; Frayling et al., 2007; Hinney et al., 2007; Scu-\nteri et al., 2007). Also, several studies reported strong\nassociations ofFTO genetic variants with obesity and\nBMI in East Asian population (Chang et al., 2008; Hotta\net al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Omori et al., 2008). A signifi-\ncant association between rs9939609 and obesity-related\ntraits (BMI, BFP, and AbFP) was detected using linear\nregression analysis (Table 2). However, there was no sig-\nnificant association with WHR and SNPs, nor any statisti-\ncally significant relationship between different genders\n(data not shown).\nIn our study, we replicated the significant associa-\ntion between rs9939609 and obesity-related traits, such\nas BMI, BFP, and AbFP. Individuals carrying the minor\nallele (A) of rs9939609 had higher BMI than those carry-\ning the homozygous major allele (TT). The frequency of\nminor allele carriers (AA/AT) of rs9939609 associated\nwith the risk of overweight was about 12.62% in this\nstudy, and the frequency of homozygotes with the A\nallele was only 1.7% in Koreans. Thus, our results are\nsimilar to those of Lee et al. (2010). This risk allele was\nrare in Asians (12.6%) compared with Europeans (45%)\nand West Africans (52%), and the variance in BMI\nattributed to rs9939609 was also much lower (/C240.5%)\nthan in Europeans (/C241%) (Chang et al., 2008; Frayling\net al., 2007).\nAlthough variants in FTO causally linked to obesity\nare less common in Korean population, many studies\nshow that theFTO gene affects obesity in East Asians.\nSeveral genome-wide association studies (GWAS) per-\nformed in Asian countries have also demonstrated signif-\nicant associations of well-known FTO variants with\nobesity and BMI (Chang et al., 2008; Cho et al., 2009;\nHuang, Sun, & Sun, 2011; Ng et al., 2008; Sull, Lee, &\nJee, 2013; Takeuchi et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2008). Cho\net al. (2009) reported that rs9939609 was strongly associ-\nated with BMI using the KARE sample in Korea,\nsuggesting that rs9939609 showed a strong correlation\nwith the underlying causative variant. Similarly, Luglio\nand Sulistyoningrum (2014) analyzed samples from\n\u201cCaucasian\u201d in Europe and North America and Asians\nfrom East and Southeast Asia and observed that minor\nallele frequency in Asians was lower than in individuals\nof European descent (Luglio & Sulistyoningrum, 2014).\nInterestingly, the OR for obesity was similar between the\ntwo sets of populations. They concluded that although\nminor allele frequency in Europeans was higher than\nAsians, the influence on obesity was similar, supporting\nthe higher predominance of obesity in Europeans\n(Luglio & Sulistyoningrum, 2014).\nOn the other hand, in seeking the biological basis for\nthe interaction, one study reported that obesity-related\nFTO gene restricts functions of the hippocampus\n(Spychala & R\u00fcther, 2019). The loss of FTO increases\nstress parameters such as corticosterone in the blood\nplasma, which suggests hypersensitivity of the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition,\nSpychala and R\u00fcther pointed out that blockingFTO gene\ncan have negative effects on the regular function of the\nhippocampus (Spychala & R\u00fcther, 2019). In parallel,FTO\ngene was related to depression, which is characterized by\na deficient of reward-seeking behavior (Samaan\net al., 2013; Shankman, Klein, Tenke, & Bruder, 2007).\nSamaan et al. provided the meta-analysis of the associa-\ntion between obesity and depression and suggested that\ndepression improves the effect of FTO variants on\nobesity.\nNumerous studies involving various ethnic and age\ngroups investigated whether the interaction between\nphysical activity and FTO genetic variants affected obe-\nsity risk. Our study focused on the genetic association\nbetweenFTO polymorphisms in KARE cohort and obe-\nsity and evaluated the effects of lifestyle factors such as\nphysical activity. In contrast to studies related to food\nintake (Park et al., 2013) or increased appetite (Wardle\net al., 2008), the results related to the effects of physical\nTABLE 3 Results of the HaploReg\nof three SNPs in theFTO gene\nSNP A1 A2\nHaploReg\nDNase Enhancer histone marks Motifs changed\nrs9939609 A T BRST Nanog, Pou5f1\nrs7193144 C T 13 tissues 4 altered motifs\nrs9940128 A G 14 tissues 14 tissues Ets, NF-AT1, TATA\nNote: HaploReg is a tool used to explore annotations of candidate regulatory SNPs (http://\narchive.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg_v3.php).\nAbbreviations: A1, minor allele; A2, major allele; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism.\n6o f1 0 CHO ET AL.\n",

    "activity varied among studies, largely depending on\nwhether or not A allele, which is a risk allele of\nrs9939609, was related to exercise.\nThe key finding of our study was that the association\nbetween FTO gene polymorphism and exercise was signifi-\ncant only in subjects with the A allele (AA/AT) (Figure 1).\nLee et al. observed the effect ofFTO variants on fat mass\nand its changes by physical activity in Korean population.\nAlso, West et al. showed that the difference in patterns of\nphysical activity betweenFTO genotypes may further offset\nthe adiposity-increasing effect ofFTO within the European\ncohort (West et al., 2018). Other studies have reported that\nphysical inactivity confers an increased risk ofFTO genetic\npredisposition to obesity while physically active partici-\npants who carry risk alleles ofFTO SNPs exhibited a lower\nrisk (Demerath et al., 2011; Kilpelainen et al., 2011; Kim\net al., 2016). Finally, Payne et al. demonstrated the interac-\ntions between genetic susceptibility of obesity caused by\ntwo SNPs (rs9939609 and rs1421085) in theFTO gene and\nphysical activity (Payne et al., 2014). With consistent repli-\ncations of the association betweenFTO genetic variants\nand obesity-related phenotypes, it is of growing interest to\ndetermine whether these genetic effects on obesity are\nmodified by lifestyle factors such as physical activity.\nIn this regard, a few studies failed to detect the effect\nof any interaction between physical activity and FTO\nSNPs on obesity (Cho et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011).\nNonetheless, physical activity levels betweenFTO geno-\ntypes conflict with previous studies suggesting that the\nFTO genotype does not affect the physical activity level\n(Hakanen et al., 2009). Berentzen et al. (2008) reported a\nlack of effect of theFTO variant on physical activity in\nindividuals classified by the authors as highly active, and\nthe effect of FTO genotype on activity levels in cohorts\nwith even greater levels of physical activity is unknown.\nBy contrast, our data represent unequivocal evidence that\nphysical activity attenuates the effect of theFTO genetic\nvariants on obesity, based on data from 8840 individuals\nin the KARE database.\nWhile believing our results to be informative, this study\nhas some limitations. The contrasting results of the current\nstudy and other evidence may be attributed to the high\nlevels of intense physical activity of individuals within the\ncurrent study. Consequently, future studies are required to\nexamineFTO-mediated differences in physical activity\namong individuals with varying activity. Further measures\nof body adiposity and precise standards of physical activity\nrequired to replicate the current study's findings.\nCurrently, the strongest associations between FTO\nSNPs and obesity belong to intronic SNPs, which play a\nrole in the regulation of genes close toFTO. We found\nthat multiple neighboring SNPs (Figure 2) also show\nhighly significant association with BMI. All GWAS\nidentified SNPs belong to the same highly correlated clus-\nter, with an LD ofr2 > 0.80, and consequently are associ-\nated with BMI at similar significance levels, as well as\nother obesity-related traits (Loos & Yeo, 2014). Our\nresults demonstrate that, in the KARE cohort, rs9926289\n(D0 =1 , r2 = 1), rs8050136 ( D0 = 0.99, r2 = 0.99),\nrs7193144 (D0 = 0.99,r2 = 0.98), and rs1121980 (D0 = 0.99,\nr2 = 0.88) are associated with increased BMI associated\nwith rs9939609 (Figure 2). Shabana et al. showed that the\nFTO variants rs9939609 and rs9926289 exhibit a strong\ncodominant, obesity-predisposing effect of genotypes\nhomozygous for minor alleles (Shabana &\nHasnain, 2015). Interestingly, Shabana et al. showed that\nrs9939609 and rs9926289 were significantly associated\nwith BMI and waist circumference (P < .0125) but not\nwith WHR. However, rs8050136 and rs9939690 were not\nassociated with BMI either, although one variant,\nrs8050136, was associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes\nrs8050136 in a Japanese (Horikoshi et al., 2007).\nTo further examine the LD block that is significantly\nassociated with obesity, we used the HaploReg (v4.1)\ndatabase, in which the most significant rs9939609 SNP\nwas identified using an imputation method based on\nAsian (Japanese in Tokyo (JPT), Han Chinese in Beijing\n(CHB), Southern Han Chinese (CHS)) reference panels\nacquired from the 1000 Genomes Project and based on\nan association analysis. We found that 91 genetic variants\nsignificantly regulated the expression of the nearbyFTO\ngene. Among the 91 SNPs, 80 of them carried functional\nmotifs including rs9939609, suggesting that they may\nplay a role in the expression and/or regulation of the\nFTOgene (Table S3). HaploReg database further suggests\nthat rs7193144 and rs9940128 carry a significant regula-\ntory potential due to the presence of histone marks asso-\nciated with enhancers in various tissues (Table 3). Our\nstudy showed similar results (Table 2), demonstrating the\nsignificant association of rs7193144 and rs9940128 with\nobesity as reported previously (Hinney et al., 2007; Peng\net al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012).\nIn the current study, higher physical activity reduced\nthe risk of obesity via interaction with specific genotypes.\nOur results are consistent with the basic concept that\nphysical activity attenuated obesity mediated via the A\nallele carriers. However, in individuals with specific\ngenetic predisposition, particularly homozygous major\nallele carriers, a higher level of physical activity is\nrequired to significantly reduce the risk of obesity.\n5 | CONCLUSION\nOur study found that theFTO variant rs9939609 is signif-\nicantly associated with weight, BMI, and other obesity-\nCHO ET AL. 7o f1 0\n\n\nrelated phenotypes in a KARE cohort.
