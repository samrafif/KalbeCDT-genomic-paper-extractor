Phenotypes of interest were thecompetitive event\ntime at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled,\nthe fastest reported timing ever achieved in an Olympus Marathon, and\nhow many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the previous year.\n</SENT 01_02>\n<SENT 01_03>\nEleven polymorphisms in/H92513-actinin ( ACTN3), AMP deaminase-1\n(AMPD1), bradykinin B 2 receptor (BDKRB2), /H92522-adrenergic receptor\n(ADRB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A), PPAR-/H9251(PPARA), PPAR-/H9254(PPARD), and apoliprotein E (APOE) were evaluated.Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing\non the overall cohort of male athletes showed a significant deviation for\nBDKRB2rs1799722 (P /H110050.018;P /H110050.006 when limited to 316 habitual\nmale runners) with an excess of the TT genotype.\n</SENT 01_03>\n<SENT 01_04>\nAcross all athletes, no\nassociations showed nominal statistical significance for any of the\nthree phenotypes, and the same was true when analyses were limited\nto men (n /H11005417).When limited to 316 male athletes who identified\nrunning as their preferred sport, ADRB2 rs1042713 had nominally\nsignificant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for\nthe fastest time ever (P /H110050.01).The direction of effect was identical\nas previously postulated only for BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713, indicating consistency.BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance\nperformance among habitual runners and require further investigation.\n</SENT 01_04>\n<SENT 01_05>\ngenetics; endurance\nPHYSICAL FITNESS is a very complex phenotype influenced by\nnumerous genetic and environmental factors contributing to the\nobserved interindividual variation not only in the general\npopulation but also in trained athletes (24).Numerous studies\nhave been performed in the last decade to try to establish\nwhether specific genes with postulated functional roles in\nhuman physiology influence athletic performance and endurance, and a growing number of candidate gene associations\nhave been proposed (5, 27).\n</SENT 01_05>\n<SENT 01_06>\nStudies have varied in sample size\nand type of population, and several proposed associations have\nnot been consistently replicated in independent investigations\nby different teams of investigators.Multiple genetic loci are likely to underlie the heritability of\nthe complex phenotype of athletic performance.Some aspects\nof this phenotype have high estimated heritability, for example,\nthe heritability of maximal O2 uptake (V\u02d9O2max)i s /H1101150% in\nboth the sedentary state and after training (3, 4).Even if\nheritability is less for other aspects of athletic performance,\neach genetic variant is likely to explain only a small fraction of\nthe genetic predisposition.\n</SENT 01_06>\n<SENT 01_07>\nRecently, Williams and Folland (44)\ncalculated the probability that exists for an individual to be in\npossession of any of the most optimal of the 23 selected\npolymorphisms related to athletic performance.Studies investigating the collective influence of a number of genetic polymorphisms could possibly help unravel and thus possibly better\nexplain the inherent individual variations in athletic performance.In the present study, we studied participants in the\nOlympus Marathon, an athletic event that requires considerable\nendurance and for which there are large differences in performance among the participants.The optimal physiological phenotype of athletes competing in long-duration events probably\nentails an inherent genetic makeup conferring cardiovascular,\npulmonary, and skeletal competence to perform during such\nevents and efficient metabolism of available substrates to\nsustain the performance throughout the event\u2019s duration.\n</SENT 01_07>\n<SENT 01_08>\nWe evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\neight genes that have known functional roles, and we based our\nselection on previous gene association studies investigating\naspects of athletic endurance.In particular, the selected genes\nin our study have been previously associated with appropriate\nsubstrate metabolism as a source of energy during exercise, in the\ncardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise that would\nallow for a much efficient O2 uptake and transfer to the muscles\nfor utilization, and/or in muscle contractility suitable for the\npurposes of endurance performance.\n</SENT 01_08>\n<SENT 01_09>\nMoreover, the selected\npolymorphisms had been evaluated in the past in one or more\nstudies, where at least one of the studies had reported significant associations with endurance performance (5, 27).METHODS\nCohort participants.We enrolled athletes participated in the annual\nOlympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece.We only\nenrolled athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry to avoid confounding\ndata from population stratification.Athletes were approached at the\ncompetition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of\nthe research team.\n</SENT 01_09>\n<SENT 01_10>\nThey were informed about the aim and purpose of\nthe study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in\nparticipating in the study.Written informed consent was obtained\nAddress for reprint requests and other correspondence: J.

the Oragene collection\ntube also contained 2 ml of stabilizing agent.All samples were\ncollected at the competition site in Greece and were then sent for\nanalysis at Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).Samples were processed using a PUREGENE DNA Purification kit (DNA Genotek\u2019s Oragene DNA Purification protocol, DNA\nGenotec, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\n</SENT 02_03>\n<SENT 02_04>\nFor DNA isolation, 3 ml of the\nsaliva mixture were used, and 120 ml of Oragene purifier were added.After a 10-min incubation on ice, the vial was spun down, and the\npellet was discarded.Subsequently, an equal volume of ethanol was\nadded to precipitate the DNA.After a 10-min incubation at room\ntemperature, the vial was spun down, the supernatant was discarded,\nand the pellet was air dried.The DNA pellet was then dissolved in 300\nml MilliQ water.Polymorphisms under study.The selected genes, their respective\nSNP identification numbers, and the implicated function of these\ngenes are shown in Table 1.For all genes under study, one variant has\nbeen investigated for associations with endurance performance and\nrelated phenotypes except for the peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor (PPAR)-/H9254gene ( PPARD), where three variants have been\nproposed to affect endurance.\n</SENT 02_04>\n<SENT 02_05>\nFor all SNPs, Taqman assays were\ngenerated and applied according to the manufacturers\u2019s specifications.Results were analyzed with the ABI Taqman 7900HT using sequence\ndetection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA).To confirm the accuracy of the genotyping results, 5% of the\nrandomly selected samples were regenotyped with the same method.No inconsistencies were observed.All primers and probes used in the\npresent study are available on request.Phenotypes.We defined a priori the following phenotypes: 1) the\nevent completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the\nathlete was enrolled in the study,2) the fastest reported event\ncompletion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race, and\n3) how many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 mo\nbefore enrollment in the study.For athletes who ran both years and were included in our sample\nsize, we used for the time to finish the time in the year during which\nthey were first enrolled.\n</SENT 02_05>\n<SENT 02_06>\nHowever, if they only completed one of the\ntwo races, then we used the time when they completed the race.All\nathletes that exceeded the time limit for finishing the race set by the\norganizing committee (12 h in 2007 and 10 h in 2008) were personally\ncontacted to provide a self-reported time finish, since the official time\nwas not available.Statistical analyses.Genotypes for each tested polymorphism were\ntested for compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\nlaw using an exact test.Deviations from HWE may be due to different\nreasons (31), but, in this design, they may also be used as a crude test\nof association (36), since the analyzed cohort is a selected population\nTable 1.\n</SENT 02_06>\n<SENT 02_07>\nPolymorphisms under study\nGene Name Major Role rs Number(s) Genotypes, number (%)\nACTN3 /H92513-Actinin Skeletal muscle component rs1815739 CT: 214 (48.9) CC: 132 (30.1) TT: 85 (19.4) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\nAMPD1 AMP deaminase-1 Skeletal muscle metabolism rs17602729 GG: 336 (76.7) AG: 93 (21.2) AA: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\nBDKRB2 Bradykinin B2 receptor Bradykinin receptor rs1799722 CC: 169 (38.6) CT: 183 (41.8) TT: 80 (18.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\nADRB2 /H92522-Adrenergic receptor Adrenergic receptor rs1042713 GG: 165 (37.7) GA: 207 (47.3) AA: 60 (13.7) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\nPPARGC1A PPAR coactivator-1/H9251Regulation of energy\nmetabolism genes\nrs8192678 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\nPPARA PPAR-/H9251/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs4253778 GG: 284 (64.8) GC: 135 (30.8) CC: 15 (3.4) Undetermined: 4 (0.9)\nPPARD PPAR-/H9254/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs6902123 TT: 351 (80.1) TC: 78 (17.8) CC: 2 (0.5) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\nrs1053049 TT: 221 (50.5) CT: 188 (42.9) CC: 23 (5.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)rs2267668 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.4)\nAPOE Apolipoprotein E Binding and catabolism of\nlipoproteins\nrs7412 and rs429358 other/other: 366 (83.5) \u03b54/other: 59 (13.5) \u03b54/ \u03b54: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 9 (2.1)\nPPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.For APOE, the two polymorphisms are linked and define six possible genotypes ( \u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b54, \u03b54/\u03b54, and \u03b52/\u03b54).568 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON RUNNERS\nJ Appl Physiol VOL 108  MARCH 2010  www.jap.org\nDownloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jappl (110.138.091.074) on January 26, 2023.\n</SENT 02_07>\n",

allele was significantly more prevalent in the endurance athletes (45).ARDB2 regulates the cardiopulmonary response to exercise (36), and this polymorphism has been\ninvestigated in many phenotypes, with some evidence oflower\nmean arterial blood pressure at rest, during and after exercise for\nArg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in\npatients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased thermogenic responses to/H92522-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\n</SENT 06_01>\n<SENT 06_02>\nAMPD1 (rs17602729), which functions in skeletal muscle\nmetabolism (salvage of adenine nucleotides) and is involved in\nthe regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise\n(29), was evaluated in a case-control study (n /H11005104 endurance\nathletes vs. 100 controls).The minor (A) allele was actually\nsignificantly less common in endurance athletes than in controls, but endurance indexes such as V\u02d9O2max, ventilatory threshold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the\nminor allele (29).\n</SENT 06_02>\n<SENT 06_03>\nFurthermore,AMPD1 rs17602729 was evaluated in a study assessing physiological responses in 503\nindividuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime, and the minor\nallele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to\nendurance (28).Therefore, our results are in the opposite\ndirection for this polymorphism than what prior studies had\nsuggested.Discrepancies may be due to different study design,\nsetting, types of athletes, and phenotype definitions, but most\nlikely they simply represent false positives in opposite directions, and this polymorphism is not credibly associated with\nendurance performance.Incidentally, there is a case report (19)\non a world-class athlete with exceptionally favorable laboratory indexes for endurance performance (V\u02d9O2max) despite car rying the A allele (19), which further documents that these\ngenetic effects, even if present, are subtle and do not doom\none\u2019s athletic performance.\n</SENT 06_03>\n<SENT 06_04>\nVariation at the BDKRB2 (rs1799722) gene locus, which\nencodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the\nincrease of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise\n(34), has also been associated with endurance performance in\nprevious studies.In one study (43), athletes (n /H1100581) competing in longer distance events had a significantly higher frequency of the/H110029 allele, a 9-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 1.In a study of 453 athletes who completed the\nSouth Africa Ironman Triathlon, the athletes had a significantly\nhigher frequency of the/H110029//H110029 genotype compared with the\ncontrols (n /H11005203) (34).In that same study (34), the /H110029 allele\nwas not significantly different in three groups of athletes who\ncompleted the event in fast, medium, and slow times (34).\n</SENT 06_04>\n<SENT 06_05>\nThe\n/H110029 allele has been demonstrated to result in increased transcription rates of the gene (6).In our study, we focused only on\nSNPs rather than insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and we\ninstead genotyped the promoter variant rs1799722 (also known\nas/H1100258C/T), which is also known to have a functional impact\non the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele\nin luciferase experiments (15).We found results consistent\nwith previous evidence: the high transcription allele was overrepresented in this group of endurance athletes and, even more\nso, among those who are habitual runners.The same promoter\nvariant has also been associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baroreflex sensitivity (7, 22).\n</SENT 06_05>\n<SENT 06_06>\nAll of the other polymorphisms that showed no nominally\nsignificant signals in our study have been examined in the past\nin at least one other study, but the evidence was often inconclusive or may be stronger for associations with phenotypes\nthat have only indirect bearing on athletic endurance performance.Moreover, we only examined specific polymorphisms\nfor each one of these genes, so we cannot exclude that other\nvariants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic\nperformance in particular populations.\n</SENT 06_06>\n<SENT 06_07>\nFinally, our study was\npowered to detect modest effects, but subtle effects for variants\nwith minor allele frequencies/H1102110% may have been missed.Specifically, in /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally significant.\n</SENT 06_07>\n<SENT 06_08>\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\nendurance outcome (based on competitor finish time) during\nthe South Africa \u00c9ronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were observed in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls) between\ngroups and when laboratory endurance performance indexes\nwere evaluated.PPAR-/H9251(PPARA) rs4253778 is an intronic variant that is\ninvolved in the regulation of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\nlipid metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis (39).\n</SENT 06_08>\n<SENT 06_09>\nThis\nvariant was investigated in a multisport case-control study (2)\n(n /H11005786 Russian athletes vs. 1,242 controls) stratified by\nperformance (endurance, sprint, and mixed) in which endurance athletes had significantly higher frequency of the G allele\nthan controls.Thesame polymorphism was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in Africadescended people but not in Caucasians (35).It is unknown\nwhether ancestry-specific genetic effects (11) may also be\nimportant in athletic performance.PPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation, glucose utilization, mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, angiogenesis, and muscle fiber type (39), and\nPPAR-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A; rs8192678) regulates\ngenes involved in energy metabolism and is associated with\nmitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle fiber type conversion (20).\n</SENT 06_09>\n<SENT 06_10>\nBoth genes seem to have independent effects on\nthe effectiveness of aerobic exercise training to increase aerobic physical fitness and insulin sensitivity (39).Furthermore, a\nwhole body MRI study (38) found differential changes after\nlifestyle intervention in overall adiposity, hepatic fat storage,\nand relative muscle mass for the rs1053049, rs6902123, and\nrs2267668 variants ofPPARD (38).Moreover, in a multisport\ncase-control study (1) ( n /H110051,256 athletes vs. 610 controls),\nPPARD allelic differences were seen in endurance athletes but\nnot in controls (1), and another case-control study (20) found\nthat the minor allele ofPPARGC1A rs8192678 was significantly more common in unfit controls ( n /H11005100) than in\nendurance athletes ( n /H11005104).However, it is unclear whether\nsuch associations would result also in noticeable differences in\nperformance among endurance athletes besides differentiating\nathletes from controls.\n</SENT 06_10>\n<SENT 06_11>\nSimilarly, for apolipoprotein E (APOE;\nrs7412 and rs429358), which facilitates triglyceride clearance\nby mediating lipoprotein binding to hepatic receptors, thus\ncontributing to the variability in individual response to exercise\ntraining (41), the\u03b54 allele in previous studies (8, 41) was found\nto be associated with better physiological responses after ex572 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON

Ogden et al., 2006).Genetic variants of the FTO (fat mass and obesity\nassociated) gene, located on chromosome 16q12.2, are\ncorrelated with obesity and higher body mass indexHye-Won Cho and Hyun-Seok Jin contributed equally to this study.Received: 12 March 2020 Revised: 29 June 2020 Accepted: 29 July 2020\nDOI: 10.1002/ajhb.23489\nAm J Hum Biol.2020;e23489.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajhb \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC 1o f1 0\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23489\n</SENT 09_04>\n\n\n<SENT 10_01>\n(BMI) in humans (Cornes et al., 2009; Frayling\net al., 2007; Koike, Richards, Wong, & Hardy, 2018;\nLoos & Yeo, 2014).Heritability estimates for obesityrelated traits indicate that a substantial proportion of\nphenotypic variation still needs to be explained\n(O'Rahilly & Farooqi, 2008).It is proposed that the interaction between FTO gene and lifestyle factors may contribute to the variability of those traits, since many\nstudies have shown controversial results or negligible\ninteractive effects.Previous studies have demonstrated a link between\nFTO and higher BMI in humans.\n</SENT 10_01>\n<SENT 10_02>\nIndividuals with first\nintron rs9939609 FTO obesity-risk allele (homozygous = AA and heterozygous = AT) were found to\nexhibit higher BMI than those with wild-type alleles\n(TT) (Qi et al., 2014; Saber-Ayad et al., 2019).Recent\nstudies reported an interaction betweenFTO genotypes,\nphysical inactivity, and BMI (Leonska-Duniec\net al., 2018; Liaw, Liaw, & Lan, 2019).Higher levels of\nphysical activity reduced the likelihood of being overweight or obese (Bernstein, Costanza, & Morabia, 2004;\nKing et al., 2001; Payne, Cahill, Sun, Loredo-Osti, &\nAbarin, 2014; Yoshioka et al., 2005).However, none of\nthese studies considered the effect of genetic factors as\nmodifiers.\n</SENT 10_02>\n<SENT 10_03>\nPhysical activity has been thought to exacerbate the effect of theFTO gene (Andreasen et al., 2008).The effect of genetic susceptibility on obesity caused by\nFTO variants can actually be attenuated by increased\nphysical activity (Vimaleswaran et al., 2009).A replication study is essential to establish the\nreported genetic association, especially among\npopulations of different ethnic backgrounds.However,\nstudies involving Oceanic population (Ohashi\net al., 2007), African Americans (Hinney et al., 2007),\nHan Chinese (Li et al., 2008), and Japanese (Horikoshi\net al., 2007) failed to detect the association between previously reported SNPs and obesity or obesity-related traits\n(Chang et al., 2008).\n</SENT 10_03>\n<SENT 10_04>\nAlthough the limited sample size\nand power of these studies is the most likely reason for\nthe lack of association, evidence showed that otherFTO\nSNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs9939609\nmay be causative variants in non-European populations\n(Grant et al., 2008).Taken together, the significant role\nplayed by physical activity in the relation betweenFTO\ngenetic variant and obesity across different cultures or\nethnicities needs to be established.\n</SENT 10_04>\n<SENT 10_05>\nAlthoughFTO genotypes have been reported to interact with physical activity\nand correlate with BMI (Lee et al., 2010), the direct effect\nof the risk alleles in theFTO gene and physical activity\non obesity have yet to be reported in the Korean\npopulation.Although physical activity has been shown to facilitate weight loss and weight maintenance in obese\nsubjects, a tremendous interindividual variation exists\n(Perusse et al., 2000).It is unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, attenuate obesity in individuals with an underlyingFTO genetic predisposition.Thus, the objective of this study was to further\nexplore the relationships between physical activity,FTO\nSNPs, and obesity within a Korean population.\n</SENT 10_05>\n<SENT 10_06>\nWe\nbelieve that our results pertaining to obesity and physical\nactivity are important and widely applicable to the obesity health promotion program.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 | Subjects\nA total of 8840 subjects aged 40 to 69 years were recruited\nfrom the Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean\nGenome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), which represent rural and urban communities in Korea, respectively.The baseline survey of the KoGES involved a total of\n10 038 adults from 2001 to 2002, surveyed biannually.The Korea Association Resource (KARE) project facilitated the availability of DNA in the large-scale genomewide analysis of 10 004 participants, following which\n8840 genotypes were released into the public domain\n(Lee et al., 2010).\n</SENT 10_06>\n<SENT 10_07>\nA detailed analysis of Ansung and\nAnsan cohorts has been published previously (Cho\net al., 2007).The participant survey involved not only\ntheir parents' health history and anthropometric data\nsuch as height, weight, and waist and hip circumference,\nbut also education and income, physical activity, and dietary intake.We categorized the participants as nonobese\n(18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (30 kg/m2 \u2264 BMI).We\nfollowed the WHO cutoffs to delineate obesity (BMI of\n25.0-29.99 for overweight [preobesity] and\u226530.0 for obesity) (World Health Organization, 2000).\n</SENT 10_07>\n<SENT 10_08>\nThe genetic\ninformation used in this study was distributed by the\nHuman Resources Bank of Korea Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (KBN-2017-046) and analyzed\nafter approval of the research ethics committee of the\nKorea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and Hoeso\nUniversity (1041231170418-HR-056-02).Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.2.2 | Anthropometry and physical\nactivity\nHeight, weight, and circumference of waist and hips were\nmeasured by qualified medical staff, and BMI (weight (kg)/\nheight (m2)) and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR = waist measurement (cm)/hip measurement (cm)) were calculated.2o f1 0 CHO ET AL.\n</SENT 10_08>\n"

      "Based on the provided context, specifically SENT 01_04, the study evaluated associations of polymorphisms in eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with endurance performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners. The genes under study were:\n\n1. ACTN3 (\u03b1-actinin 3)\n2. AMPD1 (AMP deaminase 1)\n3. BDKRB2 (bradykinin B2 receptor)\n4. ADRB2 (\u03b22-adrenergic receptor)\n5. PPARGC1A (PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1)\n6. PPARA (PPAR\u03b1)\n7. PPARD (PPAR\u03b4)\n8. APOE (apolipoprotein E)\n\nHowever, the study found that only two of these genes showed nominally significant associations with endurance performance:\n\n1. BDKRB2 rs1799722 (bradykinin B2 receptor)\n2. ADRB2 rs1042713 (\u03b22-adrenergic receptor)\n\nThese associations were observed in the context of the fastest reported timing ever achieved in an Olympus Marathon. (01_04)",
      "The athletes were recruited for the study by approaching them at the competition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of the research team. (02_01)\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the study were that the athletes had to be of self-verified Greek ancestry to avoid confounding data from population stratification. (09_01)\n\nAdditionally, the athletes were informed about the aim and purpose of the study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in participating in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. (10_01)",
      "According to SENT 02_05, the three phenotypes of interest in the study were:\n\n1. The event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study.\n2. The fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race.\n3. How many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 months before enrollment in the study.\n\nThese phenotypes were measured or calculated as follows:\n\n- Event completion time: The time it took for each athlete to complete the Olympus Marathon where they were enrolled in the study. For athletes who ran both years and were included in the sample size, the time used was from the year during which they were first enrolled. If an athlete only completed one of the two races, their time from that race was used. Athletes who exceeded the time limit for finishing the race (12 hours in 2007 and 10 hours in 2008) were personally contacted to provide a self-reported time finish, as the official time was not available.\n- Fastest reported event completion time ever achieved: This was the fastest time an athlete had ever completed the Olympus Marathon, as reported by the athlete.\n- Weekly running distance: This was calculated based on how many kilometers an athlete had run per week in the 12 months before enrollment in the study.",
      "Based on SENT 01_04, when limited to 316 male athletes who identified running as their preferred sport, ADRB2 rs1042713 had nominally significant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for the fastest time ever (P < 0.01). The direction of effect was identical as previously postulated only for BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2 rs1042713, indicating consistency.\n\nAdditionally, BDKRB2 rs1799722 had a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing on the overall cohort of male athletes, with an excess of the TT genotype (P < 0.018; P < 0.006 when limited to 316 habitual male runners).\n\nTherefore, the polymorphisms that showed nominal statistical significance for any of the three phenotypes were:\n\n1. ADRB2 rs1042713 (faster times for the minor (A) allele for the fastest time ever)\n2. BDKRB2 rs1799722 (significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing)\n\nThe directions of effect were:\n\n1. ADRB2 rs1042713: faster times for the minor (A) allele\n2. BDKRB2 rs1799722: excess of the TT genotype (indicating a possible association with endurance performance)",
      "Based on SENT 02_01, the researchers accounted for potential confounding factors such as population stratification by enrolling only athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry. This was done to avoid confounding data from population stratification, which could have affected the results of the study."

By studying athletes who participate in this demanding event, the researchers aimed to identify genetic variants associated with endurance performance.

However, it is mentioned that the major allele was considered as a reference for the association analyses (SENT 03_01). \n\nTypically, in genetic association studies, the major allele is the most common allele in the population, and the minor allele is the less common allele. The major and minor alleles are often determined based on the allele frequencies in the study population or a reference population.\n\nTo determine the major and minor alleles, researchers often use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the allele frequencies in the study population or a reference population.\n2. Identify the most common allele (major allele) and the less common allele (minor allele) based on the allele frequencies.\n3. Use the major allele as a reference allele for the association analyses.\n\nWithout more information, it is difficult to determine the specific method used to determine the major and minor alleles in this study. However, it is likely that the researchers used a combination of allele frequencies and genetic software to determine the major and minor alleles for each gene variant.",

      "ADRB2 rs1042713 encodes the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, which is primarily responsible for increases in bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodilation (36). This receptor plays a crucial role in the cardiopulmonary response to exercise (36). The Arg16Gly polymorphism at this locus has been associated with various physiological responses, including lower mean arterial blood pressure at rest, during, and after exercise for Arg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in patients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased thermogenic responses to \u03b22-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\n\n(36) and (37) are references to the provided context, specifically SENT 04_01 and SENT 06_01.",
      "Based on the provided context, specifically SENT 06_02, the AMPD1 (rs17602729) polymorphism is involved in the regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise. The minor (A) allele was actually significantly less common in endurance athletes than in controls, but endurance indexes such as V\u02d9O2max, ventilatory threshold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the minor allele.\n\nHowever, a study assessing physiological responses in 503 individuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime found that the minor allele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to endurance (28). This suggests that the AMPD1 rs17602729 polymorphism may have a subtle effect on skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise, but the evidence is not conclusive, and the polymorphism is not credibly associated with endurance performance.",
      "Based on the provided context, the potential reasons for the discrepancies between the study's results and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 and its association with endurance performance are:\n\n1. Different study design (06_03): The study design, including the population size, selection criteria, and experimental setup, may have contributed to the discrepancies.\n2. Setting and types of athletes (06_03): The study population, including the type of athletes and their level of experience, may have influenced the results.\n3. Phenotype definitions (06_03): The definition of endurance performance and the specific measures used to assess it may have differed between studies.\n4. False positives in opposite directions (06_03): The study suggests that the discrepancies may simply represent false positives in opposite directions, indicating that the association between AMPD1 rs17602729 and endurance performance is not credible.\n5. Subtle genetic effects (06_03): The study notes that even if the genetic effects are present, they may be subtle and not doom one's athletic performance, as evidenced by a case report of a world-class athlete with favorable laboratory indexes for endurance performance despite carrying the A allele.\n\nThese potential reasons highlight the complexity of genetic association studies and the need for careful consideration of study design, population selection, and phenotype definitions when interpreting results.

      "The BDKRB2 rs1799722 promoter variant has a functional impact on the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele in luciferase experiments (06_05). This suggests that the T allele may lead to higher expression of the BDKRB2 gene, which encodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the increase of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise (34).",
      "Based on the context provided, specifically SENT 06_08 and SENT 06_09, it is mentioned that ancestry-specific genetic effects may be important in athletic performance. This is illustrated by the example of PPARA rs4253778, which was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in African-descended people but not in Caucasians.\n\nThis suggests that genetic effects may vary across different populations due to differences in genetic background, environmental factors, or interactions between the two. Therefore, it is possible that ancestry-specific genetic effects could influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance.\n\nFor instance, a polymorphism that is associated with athletic performance in one population may not have the same effect in another population due to differences in genetic background or environmental factors. This highlights the importance of considering population-specific effects when studying the genetic basis of athletic performance.\n\nIn the context of the study, it is mentioned that the authors only examined specific polymorphisms for each gene, so they cannot exclude the possibility that other variants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic performance in particular populations. This underscores the complexity of genetic effects and the need for further research to fully understand the relationship between genetic variation and athletic performance.\n\nIn summary, ancestry-specific genetic effects may influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance by modifying the effect of the polymorphism in different populations. This highlights the importance of considering population-specific effects when studying the genetic basis of athletic performance."

      "The study investigated several genetic variants, including ACTN3 rs1815739, AMPD1 rs17602729, and PPARGC1A rs8192678, to determine their potential effects on endurance performance. \n\nAccording to the study, the ACTN3 rs1815739 variant is associated with the R577X polymorphism, which has been linked to athletic performance in previous studies (30, 32, 23). The R577X polymorphism is a deletion of the 577th amino acid in the alpha-actinin-3 protein, which is involved in muscle contraction and relaxation. Individuals with the XX genotype (homozygous for the deletion) have been shown to have reduced endurance performance compared to those with the RR genotype (homozygous for the presence of the 577th amino acid) (30, 32, 23).\n\nThe AMPD1 rs17602729 variant is associated with the C34T polymorphism, which has been linked to muscle fatigue and endurance performance in previous studies (28, 29). The C34T polymorphism is a substitution of the 34th amino acid in the AMPD1 protein, which is involved in muscle energy metabolism. Individuals with the TT genotype (homozygous for the substitution) have been shown to have reduced endurance performance compared to those with the CC genotype (homozygous for the presence of the 34th amino acid) (28, 29).\n\nThe PPARGC1A rs8192678 variant is associated with the Gly482Ser polymorphism, which has been linked to endurance performance in previous studies (20). The Gly482Ser polymorphism is a substitution of the 482nd amino acid in the PPARGC1A protein, which is involved in muscle energy metabolism. Individuals with the GG genotype (homozygous for the presence of the 482nd amino acid) have been shown to have improved endurance performance compared to those with the SS genotype (homozygous for the substitution) (20).\n\nIn summary, the genetic variants investigated in the study potentially affect endurance performance by influencing muscle contraction and relaxation, muscle energy metabolism, and muscle fatigue. However, the study notes that the effects of these variants are subtle and may not be significant in all individuals (13).",

      "Based on SENT 07_03, the limitations of using a cohort design without a comparison against matched non-athlete controls include:\n\n1. **Low power of Hardy-Weinberg testing**: The analysis based on the Hardy-Weinberg test has low power as an association test, which may lead to missing subtle associations.\n\n2. **Potential for missed effects**: The analysis of comparative performance is based on a continuous outcome, which has good power to detect modest differences. However, most genetic effects for common variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude, and such effects could still have been missed.\n\n3. **Nominally significant associations may be false positives**: Nominally significant associations should be interpreted with caution since they may still represent false positives, and further replication of the findings in additional studies and settings is encouraged.\n\nThese limitations highlight the importance of considering the study design and the potential biases when interpreting the results of genetic association studies.",
      "The Hardy-Weinberg test's low power as an association test may have led to the potential miss of subtle associations in the study.

(03_03) However, even this analysis may not have captured all possible associations, given the complexity of the genetic factors influencing endurance performance.\n\nTherefore, the study's findings should be interpreted with caution, and further replication of the results in additional studies and settings is encouraged to confirm the associations identified.
