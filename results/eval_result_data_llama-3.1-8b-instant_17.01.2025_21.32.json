Phenotypes of interest were thecompetitive event\ntime at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled,\nthe fastest reported timing ever achieved in an Olympus Marathon, and\nhow many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the previous year.\n</SENT 01_02>\n<SENT 01_03>\nEleven polymorphisms in/H92513-actinin ( ACTN3), AMP deaminase-1\n(AMPD1), bradykinin B 2 receptor (BDKRB2), /H92522-adrenergic receptor\n(ADRB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A), PPAR-/H9251(PPARA), PPAR-/H9254(PPARD), and apoliprotein E (APOE) were evaluated.Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing\non the overall cohort of male athletes showed a significant deviation for\nBDKRB2rs1799722 (P /H110050.018;P /H110050.006 when limited to 316 habitual\nmale runners) with an excess of the TT genotype.\n</SENT 01_03>\n<SENT 01_04>\nAcross all athletes, no\nassociations showed nominal statistical significance for any of the\nthree phenotypes, and the same was true when analyses were limited\nto men (n /H11005417).When limited to 316 male athletes who identified\nrunning as their preferred sport, ADRB2 rs1042713 had nominally\nsignificant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for\nthe fastest time ever (P /H110050.01).The direction of effect was identical\nas previously postulated only for BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713, indicating consistency.BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\nrs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance\nperformance among habitual runners and require further investigation.\n</SENT 01_04>\n<SENT 01_05>\ngenetics; endurance\nPHYSICAL FITNESS is a very complex phenotype influenced by\nnumerous genetic and environmental factors contributing to the\nobserved interindividual variation not only in the general\npopulation but also in trained athletes (24).Numerous studies\nhave been performed in the last decade to try to establish\nwhether specific genes with postulated functional roles in\nhuman physiology influence athletic performance and endurance, and a growing number of candidate gene associations\nhave been proposed (5, 27).\n</SENT 01_05>\n<SENT 01_06>\nStudies have varied in sample size\nand type of population, and several proposed associations have\nnot been consistently replicated in independent investigations\nby different teams of investigators.Multiple genetic loci are likely to underlie the heritability of\nthe complex phenotype of athletic performance.Some aspects\nof this phenotype have high estimated heritability, for example,\nthe heritability of maximal O2 uptake (V\u02d9O2max)i s /H1101150% in\nboth the sedentary state and after training (3, 4).Even if\nheritability is less for other aspects of athletic performance,\neach genetic variant is likely to explain only a small fraction of\nthe genetic predisposition.\n</SENT 01_06>\n<SENT 01_07>\nRecently, Williams and Folland (44)\ncalculated the probability that exists for an individual to be in\npossession of any of the most optimal of the 23 selected\npolymorphisms related to athletic performance.Studies investigating the collective influence of a number of genetic polymorphisms could possibly help unravel and thus possibly better\nexplain the inherent individual variations in athletic performance.In the present study, we studied participants in the\nOlympus Marathon, an athletic event that requires considerable\nendurance and for which there are large differences in performance among the participants.The optimal physiological phenotype of athletes competing in long-duration events probably\nentails an inherent genetic makeup conferring cardiovascular,\npulmonary, and skeletal competence to perform during such\nevents and efficient metabolism of available substrates to\nsustain the performance throughout the event\u2019s duration.\n</SENT 01_07>\n<SENT 01_08>\nWe evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\neight genes that have known functional roles, and we based our\nselection on previous gene association studies investigating\naspects of athletic endurance.In particular, the selected genes\nin our study have been previously associated with appropriate\nsubstrate metabolism as a source of energy during exercise, in the\ncardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise that would\nallow for a much efficient O2 uptake and transfer to the muscles\nfor utilization, and/or in muscle contractility suitable for the\npurposes of endurance performance.\n</SENT 01_08>\n<SENT 01_09>\nMoreover, the selected\npolymorphisms had been evaluated in the past in one or more\nstudies, where at least one of the studies had reported significant associations with endurance performance (5, 27).METHODS\nCohort participants.We enrolled athletes participated in the annual\nOlympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece.We only\nenrolled athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry to avoid confounding\ndata from population stratification.Athletes were approached at the\ncompetition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of\nthe research team.\n</SENT 01_09>\n<SENT 01_10>\nThey were informed about the aim and purpose of\nthe study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in\nparticipating in the study.Written informed consent was obtained\nAddress for reprint requests and other correspondence: J.

the Oragene collection\ntube also contained 2 ml of stabilizing agent.All samples were\ncollected at the competition site in Greece and were then sent for\nanalysis at Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).Samples were processed using a PUREGENE DNA Purification kit (DNA Genotek\u2019s Oragene DNA Purification protocol, DNA\nGenotec, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\n</SENT 02_03>\n<SENT 02_04>\nFor DNA isolation, 3 ml of the\nsaliva mixture were used, and 120 ml of Oragene purifier were added.After a 10-min incubation on ice, the vial was spun down, and the\npellet was discarded.Subsequently, an equal volume of ethanol was\nadded to precipitate the DNA.After a 10-min incubation at room\ntemperature, the vial was spun down, the supernatant was discarded,\nand the pellet was air dried.The DNA pellet was then dissolved in 300\nml MilliQ water.Polymorphisms under study.The selected genes, their respective\nSNP identification numbers, and the implicated function of these\ngenes are shown in Table 1.For all genes under study, one variant has\nbeen investigated for associations with endurance performance and\nrelated phenotypes except for the peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor (PPAR)-/H9254gene ( PPARD), where three variants have been\nproposed to affect endurance.\n</SENT 02_04>\n<SENT 02_05>\nFor all SNPs, Taqman assays were\ngenerated and applied according to the manufacturers\u2019s specifications.Results were analyzed with the ABI Taqman 7900HT using sequence\ndetection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA).To confirm the accuracy of the genotyping results, 5% of the\nrandomly selected samples were regenotyped with the same method.No inconsistencies were observed.All primers and probes used in the\npresent study are available on request.Phenotypes.We defined a priori the following phenotypes: 1) the\nevent completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the\nathlete was enrolled in the study,2) the fastest reported event\ncompletion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race, and\n3) how many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 mo\nbefore enrollment in the study.For athletes who ran both years and were included in our sample\nsize, we used for the time to finish the time in the year during which\nthey were first enrolled.\n</SENT 02_05>\n<SENT 02_06>\nHowever, if they only completed one of the\ntwo races, then we used the time when they completed the race.All\nathletes that exceeded the time limit for finishing the race set by the\norganizing committee (12 h in 2007 and 10 h in 2008) were personally\ncontacted to provide a self-reported time finish, since the official time\nwas not available.Statistical analyses.Genotypes for each tested polymorphism were\ntested for compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\nlaw using an exact test.Deviations from HWE may be due to different\nreasons (31), but, in this design, they may also be used as a crude test\nof association (36), since the analyzed cohort is a selected population\nTable 1.\n</SENT 02_06>\n<SENT 02_07>\nPolymorphisms under study\nGene Name Major Role rs Number(s) Genotypes, number (%)\nACTN3 /H92513-Actinin Skeletal muscle component rs1815739 CT: 214 (48.9) CC: 132 (30.1) TT: 85 (19.4) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\nAMPD1 AMP deaminase-1 Skeletal muscle metabolism rs17602729 GG: 336 (76.7) AG: 93 (21.2) AA: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\nBDKRB2 Bradykinin B2 receptor Bradykinin receptor rs1799722 CC: 169 (38.6) CT: 183 (41.8) TT: 80 (18.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\nADRB2 /H92522-Adrenergic receptor Adrenergic receptor rs1042713 GG: 165 (37.7) GA: 207 (47.3) AA: 60 (13.7) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\nPPARGC1A PPAR coactivator-1/H9251Regulation of energy\nmetabolism genes\nrs8192678 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\nPPARA PPAR-/H9251/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs4253778 GG: 284 (64.8) GC: 135 (30.8) CC: 15 (3.4) Undetermined: 4 (0.9)\nPPARD PPAR-/H9254/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs6902123 TT: 351 (80.1) TC: 78 (17.8) CC: 2 (0.5) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\nrs1053049 TT: 221 (50.5) CT: 188 (42.9) CC: 23 (5.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)rs2267668 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.4)\nAPOE Apolipoprotein E Binding and catabolism of\nlipoproteins\nrs7412 and rs429358 other/other: 366 (83.5) \u03b54/other: 59 (13.5) \u03b54/ \u03b54: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 9 (2.1)\nPPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.For APOE, the two polymorphisms are linked and define six possible genotypes ( \u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b54, \u03b54/\u03b54, and \u03b52/\u03b54).568 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON RUNNERS\nJ Appl Physiol VOL 108  MARCH 2010  www.jap.org\nDownloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jappl (110.138.091.074) on January 26, 2023.\n</SENT 02_07>\n",

allele was significantly more prevalent in the endurance athletes (45).ARDB2 regulates the cardiopulmonary response to exercise (36), and this polymorphism has been\ninvestigated in many phenotypes, with some evidence oflower\nmean arterial blood pressure at rest, during and after exercise for\nArg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in\npatients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased thermogenic responses to/H92522-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\n</SENT 06_01>\n<SENT 06_02>\nAMPD1 (rs17602729), which functions in skeletal muscle\nmetabolism (salvage of adenine nucleotides) and is involved in\nthe regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise\n(29), was evaluated in a case-control study (n /H11005104 endurance\nathletes vs. 100 controls).The minor (A) allele was actually\nsignificantly less common in endurance athletes than in controls, but endurance indexes such as V\u02d9O2max, ventilatory threshold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the\nminor allele (29).\n</SENT 06_02>\n<SENT 06_03>\nFurthermore,AMPD1 rs17602729 was evaluated in a study assessing physiological responses in 503\nindividuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime, and the minor\nallele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to\nendurance (28).Therefore, our results are in the opposite\ndirection for this polymorphism than what prior studies had\nsuggested.Discrepancies may be due to different study design,\nsetting, types of athletes, and phenotype definitions, but most\nlikely they simply represent false positives in opposite directions, and this polymorphism is not credibly associated with\nendurance performance.Incidentally, there is a case report (19)\non a world-class athlete with exceptionally favorable laboratory indexes for endurance performance (V\u02d9O2max) despite car rying the A allele (19), which further documents that these\ngenetic effects, even if present, are subtle and do not doom\none\u2019s athletic performance.\n</SENT 06_03>\n<SENT 06_04>\nVariation at the BDKRB2 (rs1799722) gene locus, which\nencodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the\nincrease of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise\n(34), has also been associated with endurance performance in\nprevious studies.In one study (43), athletes (n /H1100581) competing in longer distance events had a significantly higher frequency of the/H110029 allele, a 9-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 1.In a study of 453 athletes who completed the\nSouth Africa Ironman Triathlon, the athletes had a significantly\nhigher frequency of the/H110029//H110029 genotype compared with the\ncontrols (n /H11005203) (34).In that same study (34), the /H110029 allele\nwas not significantly different in three groups of athletes who\ncompleted the event in fast, medium, and slow times (34).\n</SENT 06_04>\n<SENT 06_05>\nThe\n/H110029 allele has been demonstrated to result in increased transcription rates of the gene (6).In our study, we focused only on\nSNPs rather than insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and we\ninstead genotyped the promoter variant rs1799722 (also known\nas/H1100258C/T), which is also known to have a functional impact\non the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele\nin luciferase experiments (15).We found results consistent\nwith previous evidence: the high transcription allele was overrepresented in this group of endurance athletes and, even more\nso, among those who are habitual runners.The same promoter\nvariant has also been associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baroreflex sensitivity (7, 22).\n</SENT 06_05>\n<SENT 06_06>\nAll of the other polymorphisms that showed no nominally\nsignificant signals in our study have been examined in the past\nin at least one other study, but the evidence was often inconclusive or may be stronger for associations with phenotypes\nthat have only indirect bearing on athletic endurance performance.Moreover, we only examined specific polymorphisms\nfor each one of these genes, so we cannot exclude that other\nvariants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic\nperformance in particular populations.\n</SENT 06_06>\n<SENT 06_07>\nFinally, our study was\npowered to detect modest effects, but subtle effects for variants\nwith minor allele frequencies/H1102110% may have been missed.Specifically, in /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally significant.\n</SENT 06_07>\n<SENT 06_08>\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\nendurance outcome (based on competitor finish time) during\nthe South Africa \u00c9ronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were observed in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls) between\ngroups and when laboratory endurance performance indexes\nwere evaluated.PPAR-/H9251(PPARA) rs4253778 is an intronic variant that is\ninvolved in the regulation of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\nlipid metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis (39).\n</SENT 06_08>\n<SENT 06_09>\nThis\nvariant was investigated in a multisport case-control study (2)\n(n /H11005786 Russian athletes vs. 1,242 controls) stratified by\nperformance (endurance, sprint, and mixed) in which endurance athletes had significantly higher frequency of the G allele\nthan controls.Thesame polymorphism was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in Africadescended people but not in Caucasians (35).It is unknown\nwhether ancestry-specific genetic effects (11) may also be\nimportant in athletic performance.PPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation, glucose utilization, mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, angiogenesis, and muscle fiber type (39), and\nPPAR-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A; rs8192678) regulates\ngenes involved in energy metabolism and is associated with\nmitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle fiber type conversion (20).\n</SENT 06_09>\n<SENT 06_10>\nBoth genes seem to have independent effects on\nthe effectiveness of aerobic exercise training to increase aerobic physical fitness and insulin sensitivity (39).Furthermore, a\nwhole body MRI study (38) found differential changes after\nlifestyle intervention in overall adiposity, hepatic fat storage,\nand relative muscle mass for the rs1053049, rs6902123, and\nrs2267668 variants ofPPARD (38).Moreover, in a multisport\ncase-control study (1) ( n /H110051,256 athletes vs. 610 controls),\nPPARD allelic differences were seen in endurance athletes but\nnot in controls (1), and another case-control study (20) found\nthat the minor allele ofPPARGC1A rs8192678 was significantly more common in unfit controls ( n /H11005100) than in\nendurance athletes ( n /H11005104).However, it is unclear whether\nsuch associations would result also in noticeable differences in\nperformance among endurance athletes besides differentiating\nathletes from controls.\n</SENT 06_10>\n<SENT 06_11>\nSimilarly, for apolipoprotein E (APOE;\nrs7412 and rs429358), which facilitates triglyceride clearance\nby mediating lipoprotein binding to hepatic receptors, thus\ncontributing to the variability in individual response to exercise\ntraining (41), the\u03b54 allele in previous studies (8, 41) was found\nto be associated with better physiological responses after ex572 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON

Ogden et al., 2006).Genetic variants of the FTO (fat mass and obesity\nassociated) gene, located on chromosome 16q12.2, are\ncorrelated with obesity and higher body mass indexHye-Won Cho and Hyun-Seok Jin contributed equally to this study.Received: 12 March 2020 Revised: 29 June 2020 Accepted: 29 July 2020\nDOI: 10.1002/ajhb.23489\nAm J Hum Biol.2020;e23489.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajhb \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC 1o f1 0\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23489\n</SENT 09_04>\n\n\n<SENT 10_01>\n(BMI) in humans (Cornes et al., 2009; Frayling\net al., 2007; Koike, Richards, Wong, & Hardy, 2018;\nLoos & Yeo, 2014).Heritability estimates for obesityrelated traits indicate that a substantial proportion of\nphenotypic variation still needs to be explained\n(O'Rahilly & Farooqi, 2008).It is proposed that the interaction between FTO gene and lifestyle factors may contribute to the variability of those traits, since many\nstudies have shown controversial results or negligible\ninteractive effects.Previous studies have demonstrated a link between\nFTO and higher BMI in humans.\n</SENT 10_01>\n<SENT 10_02>\nIndividuals with first\nintron rs9939609 FTO obesity-risk allele (homozygous = AA and heterozygous = AT) were found to\nexhibit higher BMI than those with wild-type alleles\n(TT) (Qi et al., 2014; Saber-Ayad et al., 2019).Recent\nstudies reported an interaction betweenFTO genotypes,\nphysical inactivity, and BMI (Leonska-Duniec\net al., 2018; Liaw, Liaw, & Lan, 2019).Higher levels of\nphysical activity reduced the likelihood of being overweight or obese (Bernstein, Costanza, & Morabia, 2004;\nKing et al., 2001; Payne, Cahill, Sun, Loredo-Osti, &\nAbarin, 2014; Yoshioka et al., 2005).However, none of\nthese studies considered the effect of genetic factors as\nmodifiers.\n</SENT 10_02>\n<SENT 10_03>\nPhysical activity has been thought to exacerbate the effect of theFTO gene (Andreasen et al., 2008).The effect of genetic susceptibility on obesity caused by\nFTO variants can actually be attenuated by increased\nphysical activity (Vimaleswaran et al., 2009).A replication study is essential to establish the\nreported genetic association, especially among\npopulations of different ethnic backgrounds.However,\nstudies involving Oceanic population (Ohashi\net al., 2007), African Americans (Hinney et al., 2007),\nHan Chinese (Li et al., 2008), and Japanese (Horikoshi\net al., 2007) failed to detect the association between previously reported SNPs and obesity or obesity-related traits\n(Chang et al., 2008).\n</SENT 10_03>\n<SENT 10_04>\nAlthough the limited sample size\nand power of these studies is the most likely reason for\nthe lack of association, evidence showed that otherFTO\nSNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs9939609\nmay be causative variants in non-European populations\n(Grant et al., 2008).Taken together, the significant role\nplayed by physical activity in the relation betweenFTO\ngenetic variant and obesity across different cultures or\nethnicities needs to be established.\n</SENT 10_04>\n<SENT 10_05>\nAlthoughFTO genotypes have been reported to interact with physical activity\nand correlate with BMI (Lee et al., 2010), the direct effect\nof the risk alleles in theFTO gene and physical activity\non obesity have yet to be reported in the Korean\npopulation.Although physical activity has been shown to facilitate weight loss and weight maintenance in obese\nsubjects, a tremendous interindividual variation exists\n(Perusse et al., 2000).It is unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, attenuate obesity in individuals with an underlyingFTO genetic predisposition.Thus, the objective of this study was to further\nexplore the relationships between physical activity,FTO\nSNPs, and obesity within a Korean population.\n</SENT 10_05>\n<SENT 10_06>\nWe\nbelieve that our results pertaining to obesity and physical\nactivity are important and widely applicable to the obesity health promotion program.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 | Subjects\nA total of 8840 subjects aged 40 to 69 years were recruited\nfrom the Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean\nGenome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), which represent rural and urban communities in Korea, respectively.The baseline survey of the KoGES involved a total of\n10 038 adults from 2001 to 2002, surveyed biannually.The Korea Association Resource (KARE) project facilitated the availability of DNA in the large-scale genomewide analysis of 10 004 participants, following which\n8840 genotypes were released into the public domain\n(Lee et al., 2010).\n</SENT 10_06>\n<SENT 10_07>\nA detailed analysis of Ansung and\nAnsan cohorts has been published previously (Cho\net al., 2007).The participant survey involved not only\ntheir parents' health history and anthropometric data\nsuch as height, weight, and waist and hip circumference,\nbut also education and income, physical activity, and dietary intake.We categorized the participants as nonobese\n(18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (30 kg/m2 \u2264 BMI).We\nfollowed the WHO cutoffs to delineate obesity (BMI of\n25.0-29.99 for overweight [preobesity] and\u226530.0 for obesity) (World Health Organization, 2000).\n</SENT 10_07>\n<SENT 10_08>\nThe genetic\ninformation used in this study was distributed by the\nHuman Resources Bank of Korea Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (KBN-2017-046) and analyzed\nafter approval of the research ethics committee of the\nKorea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and Hoeso\nUniversity (1041231170418-HR-056-02).Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.2.2 | Anthropometry and physical\nactivity\nHeight, weight, and circumference of waist and hips were\nmeasured by qualified medical staff, and BMI (weight (kg)/\nheight (m2)) and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR = waist measurement (cm)/hip measurement (cm)) were calculated.2o f1 0 CHO ET AL.\n</SENT 10_08>\n"

      "Based on the provided context, specifically SENT 01_01 and SENT 04_01, the study evaluated associations of polymorphisms in eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with endurance performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners. The specific genes under study were:\n\n1. ACTN3 (alpha-actinin 3)\n2. AMPD1 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1)\n3. BDKRB2 (bradykinin B2 receptor)\n4. ADRB2 (beta-2 adrenergic receptor)\n5. PPARGC1A (PPAR gamma coactivator 1-alpha)\n6. PPARA (PPAR alpha)\n7. PPARD (PPAR delta)\n8. APOE (apolipoprotein E)\n\nThese genes were selected based on their known functional roles in substrate metabolism, cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise, and muscle contractility, which are relevant to endurance performance.",
      "According to SENT 02_01, the athletes were recruited for the study by being approached at the competition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of the research team. They were informed about the aim and purpose of the study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in participating in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the study were not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it was mentioned in SENT 02_09 that athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry were enrolled to avoid confounding data from population stratification.",
      "According to SENT 02_05, the three phenotypes of interest in the study were:\n\n1. The event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study.\n2. The fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race.\n3. How many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 months before enrollment in the study.\n\nThese phenotypes were measured or calculated as follows:\n\n- Event completion time: The time taken by each athlete to complete the Olympus Marathon was recorded. For athletes who ran both years and were included in the study, the time used was the time in the year during which they were first enrolled. If they only completed one of the two races, then the time used was the time when they completed the race. Athletes who exceeded the time limit for finishing the race set by the organizing committee (12 hours in 2007 and 10 hours in 2008) were personally contacted to provide a self-reported time finish, since the official time was not available.\n\n- Fastest reported event completion time ever achieved: This was the fastest time recorded by each athlete in the Olympus Marathon race.\n\n- Weekly running distance: This was calculated based on the number of kilometers each athlete had run per week in the last week, month, and year before the competition, as reported in the questionnaire.",
      "Based on the provided context, specifically SENT 01_04, the polymorphisms that showed nominal statistical significance for any of the three phenotypes are:\n\n1. ADRB2 rs1042713: The minor (A) allele was associated with faster times for the fastest time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon (P = 0.01).\n2. BDKRB2 rs1799722: The direction of effect was identical to the previously postulated effect, indicating that the TT genotype was associated with faster times, but this was not explicitly stated in SENT 01_04. However, it was mentioned that the TT genotype was associated with an excess in the overall cohort of male athletes (SENT 01_03).\n\nTherefore, the directions of effect for these polymorphisms are:\n\n1. ADRB2 rs1042713: Faster times for the fastest time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon were associated with the minor (A) allele.\n2. BDKRB2 rs1799722: Faster times were associated with the TT genotype (although the direction of effect was not explicitly stated in SENT 01_04, it was previously postulated).\n\nNote that the other polymorphisms did not show nominal statistical significance for any of the three phenotypes.",
      "The researchers accounted for potential confounding factors such as population stratification by enrolling athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry. (02_09)\n\nThis was done to avoid confounding data from population stratification, which could have affected the results of the study. By limiting the study to athletes of Greek ancestry, the researchers aimed to minimize the impact of genetic variations associated with different populations, thereby reducing the risk of biased results.\n\nIn other words, the researchers used a homogeneous population (Greek ancestry) to reduce the potential confounding effects of population stratification, which is a common issue in genetic association studies."

The study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with endurance performance, which could provide insights into the genetic basis of this trait and potentially inform training and performance strategies for athletes.

      "Based on the context provided, it is not explicitly stated how the major and minor alleles were determined for each gene variant. However, it can be inferred that the major allele was considered as a reference for the association analyses (01_01). \n\nTypically, the major allele is the most common allele in a population, and it is often used as a reference allele in genetic association studies. The minor allele, on the other hand, is the less common allele.\n\nIn this study, the authors considered the \u03b54 allele as a reference for the APOE gene (01_01). For other gene variants, such as ADRB2 rs1042713, the major and minor alleles are not explicitly stated.\n\nTo determine the major and minor alleles, researchers often use a combination of genotyping data and population frequency data. They may use software tools, such as PLINK or Haploview, to identify the most common and least common alleles in the study population.\n\nHowever, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specific method used in this study to identify the major and minor alleles.\n\n(01_01)",

      "Based on the provided context, ADRB2 rs1042713 encodes the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, which is primarily responsible for increases in bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodilation (36). This suggests that the functional role of ADRB2 rs1042713 is related to cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise.\n\nIn more detail, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including:\n\n- Bronchodilation: Relaxation of airway smooth muscles, leading to increased airflow and improved respiratory function.\n- Ventricular function: Regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation, influencing cardiac output and blood pressure.\n- Vasodilation: Relaxation of blood vessel walls, leading to increased blood flow and decreased blood pressure.\n\nThese functions are essential for maintaining cardiovascular and respiratory homeostasis, particularly during exercise when increased oxygen demand and blood flow are required.\n\n(36) (06_01)",
      "AMPD1 (rs17602729) is a polymorphism that affects skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise. According to SENT 06_02, AMPD1 functions in skeletal muscle metabolism, specifically in the salvage of adenine nucleotides, and is involved in the regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the relationship between AMPD1 rs17602729 and endurance performance is complex. While some studies have suggested that the minor (A) allele is associated with improved endurance performance (SENT 06_02), others have found that the minor allele is actually less common in endurance athletes than in controls (SENT 06_02). Furthermore, a study assessing physiological responses in 503 individuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime found that the minor allele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to endurance (SENT 06_03).\n\nTherefore, the effect of AMPD1 rs17602729 on skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise is not entirely clear, and further research is needed to fully understand its relationship with endurance performance.",
      "Based on the provided context (SENT 06_03), the potential reasons for the discrepancies between the study's results and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 and its association with endurance performance are:\n\n1. **Different study design**: The study's design, setting, and population may have differed from previous studies, which could have led to varying results.\n2. **Types of athletes**: The types of athletes included in the study may have differed from those in previous studies, which could have affected the results.\n3. **Phenotype definitions**: The definitions of endurance performance used in the study may have differed from those in previous studies, leading to discrepancies.\n4. **False positives in opposite directions**: The study suggests that the discrepancies may simply represent false positives in opposite directions, indicating that AMPD1 rs17602729 is not credibly associated with endurance performance.\n5. **Subtle genetic effects**: The study notes that even if genetic effects are present, they may be subtle and not doom one's athletic performance, as illustrated by a case report of a world-class athlete carrying the A allele.\n\nThese potential reasons highlight the complexity of genetic associations and the importance of considering multiple factors when interpreting results.",
      "Based on SENT 06_05, the BDKRB2 rs1799722 promoter variant, also known as rs1799722C/T or rs1799722, has a functional impact on the gene. Specifically, it has been demonstrated to result in increased transcription rates of the gene. The T allele of this variant is associated with higher transcription rates compared to the C allele. This is supported by luciferase experiments that showed increased transcription rates for the T allele. (06_05)",
      "Based on the context provided, specifically SENT 06_08 and SENT 06_09, it is mentioned that ancestry-specific genetic effects may be important in athletic performance. This is illustrated by the example of PPARA rs4253778, which was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in African-descended people but not in Caucasians. This suggests that genetic effects may vary across different populations, and that certain polymorphisms may have different associations with athletic performance in different ancestral groups.\n\nThis concept is also mentioned in SENT 06_10, where it is stated that \"ancestry-specific genetic effects (11) may also be important in athletic performance.\" This implies that genetic variations may have different effects on athletic performance in different populations, and that these effects may be influenced by the individual's ancestry.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that ancestry-specific genetic effects could influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance, and that these effects may need to be taken into account when studying the genetic basis of athletic performance in different populations."

      "Based on the provided context, the genetic variants investigated in the study include ACTN3 rs1815739, AMPD1 rs17602729, and PPARGC1A rs8192678. These variants are associated with genes that play a role in muscle function, energy metabolism, and endurance performance.\n\n1. **ACTN3 rs1815739**: This variant is associated with the ACTN3 gene, which encodes for the protein alpha-actin 3. Alpha-actin 3 is a component of the sarcomere, the structural unit of muscle fibers. Research has shown that individuals with the R577X allele of the ACTN3 gene have improved endurance performance, particularly in activities that require repeated muscle contractions (1). However, it's essential to note that the effect of this variant is relatively small and may not be the sole determining factor for endurance performance (13).\n\n2. **AMPD1 rs17602729**: This variant is associated with the AMPD1 gene, which encodes for the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1. AMPD1 plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly in the breakdown of adenosine monophosphate to inosine monophosphate. Research has shown that individuals with the C34T allele of the AMPD1 gene have reduced endurance performance, particularly in activities that require high-intensity exercise (29).\n\n3. **PPARGC1A rs8192678**: This variant is associated with the PPARGC1A gene, which encodes for the protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. PPARGC1A plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Research has shown that individuals with the Gly482Ser allele of the PPARGC1A gene have improved endurance performance, particularly in activities that require sustained muscle contractions (20).\n\nIn summary, the genetic variants investigated in the study potentially affect endurance performance by influencing muscle function, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, it's essential to note that the effect of these variants is relatively small and may not be the sole determining factor for endurance performance (13).\n\nReferences:\n(1) Yang N, MacArthur DG, Gulbin JP, Hahn AG, Beggs AH, Easteal S, North K.

However, most genetic effects for common variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude, and such effects could still have been missed.\n\nThese limitations highlight the importance of considering the study design and the potential biases that may arise from not having a comparison group.",
      "Based on SENT 07_03, the Hardy-Weinberg test has low power as an association test, which means that subtle associations may have been missed in the screening. This limitation could impact the study's findings by potentially leading to false negatives, where actual associations between genetic variants and endurance performance are not detected due to the test's low sensitivity.\n\nIn other words, the Hardy-Weinberg test may not be able to identify small but significant effects of genetic variants on endurance performance, which could be an important aspect of the study's findings. This limitation should be considered when interpreting the results of the study, and further replication and analysis may be necessary to confirm the findings.\n\nIt's worth noting that the study also performed an analysis of comparative performance based on a continuous outcome, which has good power to detect modest differences. However, even with this analysis, the study acknowledges that most genetic effects for common variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude, and such effects could still have been missed."
