Phenotypes of interest were thecompetitive event\\ntime at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled,\\nthe fastest reported timing ever achieved in an Olympus Marathon, and\\nhow many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the previous year.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_02&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_03&gt;\\nEleven polymorphisms in/H92513-actinin ( ACTN3), AMP deaminase-1\\n(AMPD1), bradykinin B 2 receptor (BDKRB2), /H92522-adrenergic receptor\\n(ADRB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-/H9253coactivator-1/H9251(PPARGC1A), PPAR-/H9251(PPARA), PPAR-/H9254(PPARD), and apoliprotein E (APOE) were evaluated.Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing\\non the overall cohort of male athletes showed a significant deviation for\\nBDKRB2rs1799722 (P /H110050.018;P /H110050.006 when limited to 316 habitual\\nmale runners) with an excess of the TT genotype.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_03&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_04&gt;\\nAcross all athletes, no\\nassociations showed nominal statistical significance for any of the\\nthree phenotypes, and the same was true when analyses were limited\\nto men (n /H11005417).When limited to 316 male athletes who identified\\nrunning as their preferred sport, ADRB2 rs1042713 had nominally\\nsignificant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for\\nthe fastest time ever (P /H110050.01).The direction of effect was identical\\nas previously postulated only for BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\\nrs1042713, indicating consistency.BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2\\nrs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance\\nperformance among habitual runners and require further investigation.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_04&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_05&gt;\\ngenetics; endurance\\nPHYSICAL FITNESS is a very complex phenotype influenced by\\nnumerous genetic and environmental factors contributing to the\\nobserved interindividual variation not only in the general\\npopulation but also in trained athletes (24).Numerous studies\\nhave been performed in the last decade to try to establish\\nwhether specific genes with postulated functional roles in\\nhuman physiology influence athletic performance and endurance, and a growing number of candidate gene associations\\nhave been proposed (5, 27).\\n&lt;/SENT 01_05&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_06&gt;\\nStudies have varied in sample size\\nand type of population, and several proposed associations have\\nnot been consistently replicated in independent investigations\\nby different teams of investigators.Multiple genetic loci are likely to underlie the heritability of\\nthe complex phenotype of athletic performance.Some aspects\\nof this phenotype have high estimated heritability, for example,\\nthe heritability of maximal O2 uptake (V˙O2max)i s /H1101150% in\\nboth the sedentary state and after training (3, 4).Even if\\nheritability is less for other aspects of athletic performance,\\neach genetic variant is likely to explain only a small fraction of\\nthe genetic predisposition.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_06&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_07&gt;\\nRecently, Williams and Folland (44)\\ncalculated the probability that exists for an individual to be in\\npossession of any of the most optimal of the 23 selected\\npolymorphisms related to athletic performance.Studies investigating the collective influence of a number of genetic polymorphisms could possibly help unravel and thus possibly better\\nexplain the inherent individual variations in athletic performance.In the present study, we studied participants in the\\nOlympus Marathon, an athletic event that requires considerable\\nendurance and for which there are large differences in performance among the participants.The optimal physiological phenotype of athletes competing in long-duration events probably\\nentails an inherent genetic makeup conferring cardiovascular,\\npulmonary, and skeletal competence to perform during such\\nevents and efficient metabolism of available substrates to\\nsustain the performance throughout the event’s duration.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_07&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_08&gt;\\nWe evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\\neight genes that have known functional roles, and we based our\\nselection on previous gene association studies investigating\\naspects of athletic endurance.In particular, the selected genes\\nin our study have been previously associated with appropriate\\nsubstrate metabolism as a source of energy during exercise, in the\\ncardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise that would\\nallow for a much efficient O2 uptake and transfer to the muscles\\nfor utilization, and/or in muscle contractility suitable for the\\npurposes of endurance performance.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_08&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_09&gt;\\nMoreover, the selected\\npolymorphisms had been evaluated in the past in one or more\\nstudies, where at least one of the studies had reported significant associations with endurance performance (5, 27).METHODS\\nCohort participants.We enrolled athletes participated in the annual\\nOlympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece.We only\\nenrolled athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry to avoid confounding\\ndata from population stratification.Athletes were approached at the\\ncompetition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of\\nthe research team.\\n&lt;/SENT 01_09&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 01_10&gt;\\nThey were informed about the aim and purpose of\\nthe study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in\\nparticipating in the study.Written informed consent was obtained\\nAddress for reprint requests and other correspondence: J.

The inclusion criteria specified that only athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry were included to avoid confounding data from population stratification. A total of 438 athletes who participated in the 2007 and 2008 annual running events of the Olympus Marathon were enrolled in the study. (01_09), 1. Phenotype of interest: Event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study.\\nThis phenotype was directly measured or timed, as stated in SENT 02_05: \"the event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study\".\\n\\n2. Phenotype of interest: Fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race.\\nThis phenotype was either measured directly or self-reported when the individual exceeded the time limit for finish and the official time was not available, as cited in the same SENT 02_05: \"the fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race\".\\n\\n3. Phenotype of interest: Number of kilometers run per week during the 12 months before enrollment in the study.\\nThis phenotype was self-reported based upon the participants' recollection, as referred in SENT 02_01: \"how many kilometers they had run per week in the last week, month, and year before the competition\"., In the study, only two polymorphisms showed nominally significant associations with any of the three phenotypes. These polymorphisms are:\\n\\n1. BDKRB2 rs1799722 (ID: 01_03): This polymorphism had a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 0.018 for the overall cohort of male athletes and P &lt; 0.006 when limited to 316 habitual male runners) with an excess of the TT genotype. However, there were no significant associations reported for this polymorphism with the three phenotypes of interest: competitive event time, fastest time ever, and kilometers run per week.\\n\\n2. ADRB2 rs1042713 (ID: 01_04): When limited to 316 male athletes who identified running as their preferred sport, this polymorphism had nominally significant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for the fastest time ever (P &lt; 0.01).\\n\\nThe direction of effect for both BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2 rs1042713 was identical as previously postulated, indicating consistency. The study concluded that BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2 rs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance performance among habitual runners and require further investigation., The researchers accounted for potential confounding factors such as population stratification by enrolling only athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry. This method helps mitigate the effects of population stratification as they're dealing with a more homogeneous group of individuals with a shared genetic background.

       "      <td>[The specific phenotype selected for the study was \"participation in a very demanding endurance event\" (SENT 03_01). This phenotype was chosen as it reflects overall endurance performance, which is an area of high interest in both sports and genetics research. By selecting endurance athletes who have participated in a particularly demanding event, the study intends to identify genetic variants associated with endurance performance. These genetic markers might provide insights into an athlete's ability to endure prolonged physical activities. The study aims to understand how genetic factors contribute to the observed variance in human athletic capabilities., The major and minor alleles for each gene variant were determined based on their frequency in the study population. The allele with the highest frequency is considered the major allele, while the allele with the lowest frequency is the minor allele. This identification is typically done based on the raw genotype data obtained from the study participants.\\n\\nIn the context provided, this determination is likely based on the genotype frequencies presented in Table 1. (03_01) For instance, if we look at the ADRB2 rs1042713 variant, the G allele appears to be the major allele with a frequency of 0.78, while the A allele is the minor allele with a frequency of 0.22. This convention allows for a consistent method of defining alleles in genetic studies, thereby enabling comparisons across different research studies., To answer this, we need to look into the genotype frequencies of male and female athletes separately:\\n\\n&lt;SENT 03_09&gt;\\nThe distribution of alleles and genotypes.The frequencies of the\\npolymorphisms are shown in Table 1.\\n&lt;/SENT 03_09&gt;\\n\\nUnfortunately, no information on genotype frequencies for male and female athletes separately is explicitly provided in the given text. However, we are presented with the overall population characteristics:\\n\\n&lt;SENT 03_08&gt;\\nA total of 438 athletes (417 men and\\n21 women) volunteered for the study during the 2 yr. Two\\nhundred sixty-eight athletes enrolled in 2007 and 229 athletes\\ncompleted the race; in 2008, 170 athletes enrolled and 156\\nathletes finished the race.Nine athletes who did not finish the\\nrace in the year of enrolment (2007) completed the race in\\n2008.Hence, there were 44 athletes that did not ever finish the\\nOlympus marathon.Population characteristics are shown in\\nTable 2.\\n&lt;/SENT 03_08&gt;\\n\\nGiven this information, we can assume that the frequencies of genotypes presented in Table 1 are derived from a total of 417 men and 21 women (the number of athletes per sex who volunteered).\\n\\nHowever, without direct data comparison on the genotype distribution between male and female athletes, we can't definitively conclude whether specific significant differences exist between these groups. Checking HWE and validating the distribution of genotypes in relation to male and female athletes might be needed to make a concretely accurate comparison. \\n\\nIn most genetic association studies, it is common to perform the analysis stratified by sex in order to consider possible differences between the two groups. The absence of such an analysis in the provided text suggests that no significant difference in genotype distribution might have been discovered in this particular study. However, the exact conclusion can not be drawn without explicit mention of it. This is important to note as it emphasizes the importance of gender-specific analyses in genetic research.\\n\\nRemember that the absence of information in one study does not negate the existence of these differences. It just means that they weren't found in this particular analysis., In the study context, the athletes' training volume was not consistently integrated into the initial association analyses. As per the information provided in ID: &lt;SENT 03_02&gt; and ID: &lt;SENT 03_03&gt;, the phenotypes were adjusted for age and year of the race, considering the possible impact of varying weather conditions in different years. However, the training volume data, which is the number of kilometers each athlete ran per week, was not explicitly mentioned as being incorporated into the main association analyses. \\n\\nNonetheless, in a secondary analysis on athletes who stated that running was their preferred sport, a sensitivity analysis was performed where the training volume was used as a covariate, and the association results for ADRB2 rs1042713 remained significant (ID: &lt;SENT 04_03&gt;). This suggests that the training volume can impact the association findings, although it was not a primary aspect factored into most of the association analyses described in the context. Therefore, more explicit inclusion of the training volume as a covariate might yield different or more significant results. The study could have potentially considered it from the beginning, especially given its direct relevance to athletic performance. \\n\\nRemember, scientific research often involves iterations and refinements, including the addition or modification of variables in analyses based on insights from initial results or domain knowledge. The integration of the training volume in the sensitivity analysis provides a good example of this scientific process., In the study, there are no detailed results presented regarding the pairwise interaction analysis of the significant SNPs. Therefore, it's unclear if there were any significant findings in this regard. However, you can notice from ID: [04_04], which states, \"Moreover, a secondary analysis, a pairwise interaction analysis of the significant SNPs did not provide any significant findings (not shown in detail).\" This suggests that there were no significant findings in the pairwise interaction analysis, but this doesn't provide details about which specific SNPs it was performed on. For the full details of how the authors performed these analyses, it would be necessary to refer to the original study.]</td>\n",

oflower\\nmean arterial blood pressure at rest, during and after exercise for\\nArg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in\\npatients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased thermogenic responses to/H92522-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\\n&lt;/SENT 06_01&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_02&gt;\\nAMPD1 (rs17602729), which functions in skeletal muscle\\nmetabolism (salvage of adenine nucleotides) and is involved in\\nthe regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise\\n(29), was evaluated in a case-control study (n /H11005104 endurance\\nathletes vs. 100 controls).The minor (A) allele was actually\\nsignificantly less common in endurance athletes than in controls, but endurance indexes such as V˙O2max, ventilatory threshold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the\\nminor allele (29).\\n&lt;/SENT 06_02&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_03&gt;\\nFurthermore,AMPD1 rs17602729 was evaluated in a study assessing physiological responses in 503\\nindividuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime, and the minor\\nallele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to\\nendurance (28).Therefore, our results are in the opposite\\ndirection for this polymorphism than what prior studies had\\nsuggested.Discrepancies may be due to different study design,\\nsetting, types of athletes, and phenotype definitions, but most\\nlikely they simply represent false positives in opposite directions, and this polymorphism is not credibly associated with\\nendurance performance.Incidentally, there is a case report (19)\\non a world-class athlete with exceptionally favorable laboratory indexes for endurance performance (V˙O2max) despite car rying the A allele (19), which further documents that these\\ngenetic effects, even if present, are subtle and do not doom\\none’s athletic performance.\\n&lt;/SENT 06_03&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_04&gt;\\nVariation at the BDKRB2 (rs1799722) gene locus, which\\nencodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the\\nincrease of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise\\n(34), has also been associated with endurance performance in\\nprevious studies.In one study (43), athletes (n /H1100581) competing in longer distance events had a significantly higher frequency of the/H110029 allele, a 9-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 1.In a study of 453 athletes who completed the\\nSouth Africa Ironman Triathlon, the athletes had a significantly\\nhigher frequency of the/H110029//H110029 genotype compared with the\\ncontrols (n /H11005203) (34).In that same study (34), the /H110029 allele\\nwas not significantly different in three groups of athletes who\\ncompleted the event in fast, medium, and slow times (34).\\n&lt;/SENT 06_04&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_05&gt;\\nThe\\n/H110029 allele has been demonstrated to result in increased transcription rates of the gene (6).In our study, we focused only on\\nSNPs rather than insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and we\\ninstead genotyped the promoter variant rs1799722 (also known\\nas/H1100258C/T), which is also known to have a functional impact\\non the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele\\nin luciferase experiments (15).We found results consistent\\nwith previous evidence: the high transcription allele was overrepresented in this group of endurance athletes and, even more\\nso, among those who are habitual runners.The same promoter\\nvariant has also been associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baroreflex sensitivity (7, 22).\\n&lt;/SENT 06_05&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_06&gt;\\nAll of the other polymorphisms that showed no nominally\\nsignificant signals in our study have been examined in the past\\nin at least one other study, but the evidence was often inconclusive or may be stronger for associations with phenotypes\\nthat have only indirect bearing on athletic endurance performance.Moreover, we only examined specific polymorphisms\\nfor each one of these genes, so we cannot exclude that other\\nvariants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic\\nperformance in particular populations.\\n&lt;/SENT 06_06&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_07&gt;\\nFinally, our study was\\npowered to detect modest effects, but subtle effects for variants\\nwith minor allele frequencies/H1102110% may have been missed.Specifically, in /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which\\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally significant.\\n&lt;/SENT 06_07&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_08&gt;\\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\\nendurance outcome (based on competitor finish time) during\\nthe South Africa Éronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were observed in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls) between\\ngroups and when laboratory endurance performance indexes\\nwere evaluated.PPAR-/H9251(PPARA) rs4253778 is an intronic variant that is\\ninvolved in the regulation of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\\nlipid metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis (39).\\n&lt;/SENT 06_08&gt;\\n&lt;SENT 06_09&gt;\\nThis\\nvariant was investigated in a multisport case-control study (2)\\n(n /H11005786 Russian athletes vs. 1,242 controls) stratified by\\nperformance (endurance, sprint, and mixed) in which endurance athletes had significantly higher frequency of the G allele\\nthan controls.Thesame polymorphism was found to be associated with triglyceride and apolipoprotein CIII levels in Africadescended people but not in Caucasians (35).It is unknown\\nwhether ancestry-specific genetic effects (11) may also be\\nimportant in athletic performance.PPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation,

       "      <td>[ADRB2 rs1042713 is a genetic variant in the gene encoding the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), specifically at the amino acid position 16. This variant produces a change from arginine (Arg) to glycine (Gly), which is generally referred to as the Arg16Gly polymorphism. The functional role of ADRB2 rs1042713 in the human body is associated with the activity of the β2-adrenergic receptor, which is a cell surface protein primarily responsible for bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodilation.\\n\\nIn the muscular and respiratory systems, the β2-adrenergic receptor plays a critical role in response to adrenaline, a hormone released during exercise. The receptor regulates airway smooth muscle relaxation and contractile properties, as well as cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise.\\n\\nIndividuals with the Arg16 variant generally have a higher receptor density and increased intrinsic efficacy, which can lead to a heightened fight-or-flight response, potentially affecting their ability to respond to exercise and stress. However, it doesn't guarantee athletic success, as other genes, environmental factors, and training play a significant role in athleticism.\\n\\nMoreover, while ADRB2 rs1042713 might subtly influence athletic performance through its effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise, clear associations between this genetic variant and endurance performance remain modest (SENT 05_03)., The AMPD1 rs17602729 polymorphism affects skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise by influencing the function of adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 (AMPD1). This gene is responsible for the salvage of adenine nucleotides and plays a role in the regulation of muscle glycolysis during intensive exercise. The polymorphism results in a change from cytosine (C) to guanine (G), leading to a coding change from a glutamine to a stop codon at amino acid residue 255. This truncation causes the absence or reduction of AMPD1 enzymatic activity in muscle cells.\\n\\nCarriers of the nonfunctional allele have reduced or absent AMPD1 enzyme activity in their skeletal muscles, which can impair the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the glycolytic pathway. During intense exercise, the reliance on glycolytic processes increases, and reduced AMPD1 activity could disrupt the balance of adenine nucleotides, leading to premature fatigue or reduced exercise performance. (06_02)\\n\\nHowever, in the context of the study you provided (05_01 to 05_04 and 06_01 to 06_11), the AMPD1 rs17602729 polymorphism showed no nominally significant signals in relation to endurance performance among runners. Therefore, while AMPD1 rs17602729 may influence skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise on a molecular level, the association with endurance performance appears to be minimal or potentially non-existent. More research is needed to clarify the full impact of this polymorphism in athletic performance., There could be several reasons for these discrepancies between our study and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 and its association with endurance performance. These reasons include, but are not limited to:\\n\\n1. Differences in Study Design: Different studies may use different methodologies, sample sizes, and athlete types, which could lead to different results. For example, our study focused on a specific athletic event and a selected group of athletes, while other studies might have used different populations or examined multiple endurance sports. (Details in SENT 05_03 and SENT 06_03)\\n2. Genetic Heterogeneity: Genetic effects can vary across populations and ethnicities due to differences in allele frequencies, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions. Thus, the results of the current study may not be directly comparable to previous studies conducted in different populations or ethnic groups.\\n3. Context-Specific Effects: The effect of a particular gene variant on endurance performance might be context-specific, i.e., dependent on the specific endurance sport or event. As such, the discrepancy between different studies might be due to differences in the type of endurance event being considered.\\n4. Lack of Replication: Some genetic association studies may not have been replicated or validated in independent studies, making it difficult to conclude whether the associations are real or due to chance.\\n5. Inconclusive Evidence: Some studies might have shown no significant associations between a gene variant and endurance performance, but their results may not have been strong enough to rule out the possibility of a modest effect. This could lead to mixed results across different studies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the discrepancies between our study's results and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 could be due to various factors. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between genetics and athletic performance in different contexts and populations. (SENT 06_03), The BDKRB2 gene encodes for the bradykinin receptor B2, which plays a role in the increase of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise. The promoter variant rs1799722 (C/T, also known as -58T/C) affects the regulation of BDKRB2's expression.\\n\\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that the T allele of the rs1799722 variant leads to increased transcription rates for the BDKRB2 gene. This is often due to a change in the binding affinity of certain transcription factors or alterations of the overall structure of the promoter region. A study cited in the context (SENT 06_05) notes that the T allele leads to increased transcription rates in luciferase experiments.\\n\\nIn summary, the functional impact of the BDKRB2 rs1799722 promoter variant involves an alteration in the regulation of the BDKRB2 gene's expression. This modification, specifically the T allele, is associated with increased gene transcription.\\n\\nThe provided context does not specify the exact transcription factors involved or how they might be affected by this variant. Further research or studies in this area could provide a clearer understanding of the accurate transcription factors involved., Ancestry-specific genetic effects may influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance due to the differing frequencies of genetic variants across populations. Some gene variants, which can impact athletic performance, may be more common in particular populations, such as those with a long history of specific physical activities. This could result in a stronger association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance in those populations.\\n\\nFor example, in the case of /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which has been implicated in fast contraction ability by muscles, the T allele was reported at somewhat higher frequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies, but only in Caucasian populations (25, 46). If these variants are also common in specific ancestral populations, it could result in a stronger genetic effect on athletic performance for those populations compared to others where the functional variants may be less prevalent. In addition, gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions may also differ across ancestral populations, impacting how these polymorphisms affect athletic performance in various groups.\\n\\nIn summary, ancestry-specific genetic effects can influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance by varying the frequency of functional variants and modulating gene-gene or gene-environment interactions across different populations.

       "      <td>[The specific exercise training methods studied and their relationship to endurance performance were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it's clear that the context revolves around the investigation of genetic factors that may influence endurance performance in general. To get the specifics of exercise training methods, more data or inquiries regarding the study being discussed would be necessary., The genetic variants investigated in the study, primarily those in the ACTN3 rs1815739, AMPD1 rs17602729, and PPARGC1A rs8192678 genes, are believed to potentially influence endurance performance due to their roles in muscle composition, energy production, and mitochondrial function.\\n\\n1. ACTN3 rs1815739: This gene codes for alpha-actinin-3, a protein that is highly expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers and is crucial for their structure and function. A variant of this gene, R577X, leads to a loss of alpha-actinin-3, which is more common in endurance athletes, suggesting that individuals without this protein may be better suited for endurance-based sports (Yang et al., 2003 [SENT 08_10]).\\n\\n2. AMPD1 rs17602729: AMPD1 encodes an enzyme that plays a role in adenosine monophosphate metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining a balance of energy in muscles during intense exercise. The C34T variant results in a less efficient version of the enzyme, and this has been hypothesized to increase the energy reserves in type I (slow-twitch, primarily used in endurance activities) muscle fibers (Rico-Sanz et al., 2003 [SENT 28]; Ruiz et al., 2005 [SENT 08_05]; Niemi et al., 2005 [SENT 25]).\\n\\n3. PPARGC1A rs8192678: The PPARGC1A gene encodes a transcriptional coactivator that plays a critical role in mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation of metabolism, which are essential for endurance performance. The Gly482Ser variant is associated with altered gene expression and mitochondrial function, which in turn can influence an individual's ability to perform aerobic exercises (Lucia et al., 2005 [SENT 08_02]).\\n\\nIn summary, these genetic variants potentially affect endurance performance by influencing muscle composition, energy production, and mitochondrial function. However, it is essential to note that genetics alone does not determine athletic ability; environmental factors, including training and opportunities, also play significant roles in athletic performance., To answer this, we need to refer back to SENT 07_02:\\n\\nThe first study mentioned in the context is (30), where n is given as H1100539, which is world-level athletes vs. 15 national-level athletes. The second study is (32), with n: H1100546, which is endurance athletes vs. 123 controls. And in the third study (23), the sample size is given as H1100550, including professional cyclists vs. 52 Olympic-level runners vs. 39 world-level rowers vs. 123 controls.\\n\\nSo, the sample sizes for these three studies are 15, 123, 52, 39, and 123 respectively. However, some of these numbers including professional cyclists, Olympic-level runners, and world-level rowers are from different groups compared in the study, not just two groups as in the first two studies. So, the actual sizes of case and control groups are 15 vs. 15 (world-class athletes in the first study), and roughly 123 vs. 123 (athletes and controls in the second study), where controls might be slightly more in number since they belong to the general population. \\n\\nBut without more context about the study design, these numbers only give a vague idea of the real sample size in the case and control groups. This mathematical analysis would need to be complemented by further information about how subjects were distributed within and between these groups. The three case-control studies included varying representation of athletes and controls, which would make it difficult to draw direct comparisons without more specifics about their methodologies., The limitations of using a cohort design without a comparison against matched non-athlete controls mainly stem from the lack of a clear baseline for the genetic associations being investigated. When only examining athletes, it becomes challenging to differentiate between the genetic variations that may contribute specifically to athletic performance and those that are simply common in the general population. This is particularly relevant when looking at the allele frequencies in the sample of athletes compared to the population at large.\\n\\nAdditionally, this approach fails to account for the potential impact of environmental factors that may also contribute to athletic performance, such as access to training facilities or nutrition. These factors could affect the allele frequencies observed in the athlete population, making it difficult to attribute any observed differences entirely to genetics.\\n\\nWe can represent this point scientifically based on SENT 07_03:\\n\"We used a cohort design and did not make a comparison against matched nonathlete controls from the general population.Therefore, we performed two analyses for association: a first crude screening based on the Hardy-Weinberg test and another based on association for continuous outcomes of endurance performance within the cohort of athletes. Hardy-Weinberg testing has low power as an association test, and subtle associations may have been missed in this screening. The analysis of comparative performance is based on a continuous outcome, and it has good power to detect modest differences, but most genetic effects for common variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude (13), and such effects could still have been missed.\"\\n\\nTo put it in simpler terms, studying just athletes limits our ability to understand how much of the genetic differences we observe are actually related to athletic performance, rather than other factors., The Hardy-Weinberg test's low power as an association test means that it may not effectively detect subtle genetic associations in the study. Despite its benefits in screening for such associations (SENT 07_03), the limitations in using this test as an association test may lead to missed effects, some of which could contribute significantly to human physical performance and athletic potential. For instance, it might overlook effects of certain genes or polymorphisms that play a role in determining one's ability to perform in endurance activities. Hence, the findings of the study could be limited, and further testing through different methods could be worthwhile to confirm or disprove the existing findings. (07_03)]</td>\n",

Participants were asked if they performed 3 hours or more of daily intense activity. This threshold was then used to classify subjects into physically active and less active groups. However, note that this self-reporting method likely lacks the precision of more objective measurements, like the use of accelerometers or heart rate monitors. Therefore, it should be interpreted with caution, as it may be subject to recall or response bias. (ID: [10_07]), Based on the provided context, we do not have specific data comparing the association between FTO rs9939609 and obesity in rural vs. urban populations within the Korean population. The context discusses a study conducted on 8840 individuals representing both the rural and urban communities in Korea (Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study), but there is no explicit comparison of the findings between the two populations. (09_02)\\n\\nTo precisely answer this question, further research should be conducted, focusing on comparing the associations between FTO rs9939609 and obesity in both rural and urban Korean populations. This could involve separate analyses of the Ansung (rural) and Ansan (urban) cohorts and a comparison of the results. Establishing this distinction could potentially provide valuable insights into how genetics and environment interact to affect obesity in different segments of the Korean population. Further context can be found in the original research article provided above., To accurately answer the question, I turned to the provided text for context. I found that the study's information regarding potential confounding factors is not explicitly mentioned. Thus, without additional information about the measures taken by the study to account for these factors and their potential effect on the results, I can't definitively say whether potential confounding factors such as diet and socioeconomic status were controlled for when examining the relationship between physical activity, FTO rs9939609, and obesity. However, a rigorous study would indeed typically attempt to control for these factors to strengthen the findings. (ID: 09_07, 09_03, 09_06), In the study referenced by ID: &lt;09_02&gt;, the authors defined \"active exercise\" as engaging in 3 hours or more of daily intense activity. This criterion was used to categorize study participants in relation to their physical activity levels. The exact nature of the activity was not specified, but it was likely a measure of regular, sustained engagement in vigorous exercise. Further details might be available in the study's methodology, but for the scope of the provided content, 3 hours or more of daily intense activity is the definition of \"active exercise.\"]</td>\n",

endurance\\nPHYSICAL FITNESS is a very complex phenotype influenced by\\nnumerous genetic and environmental factors contributing to the\\nobserved interindividual variation not only in the general\\npopulation but also in trained athletes (24).Numerous studies\\nhave been performed in the last decade to try to establish\\nwhether specific genes with postulated functional roles in\\nhuman physiology influence athletic performance and endurance, and a growing number of candidate gene associations\\nhave been proposed (5, 27).\\n</SENT 01_05>\\n<SENT 01_06>\\nStudies have varied in sample size\\nand type of population, and several proposed associations have\\nnot been consistently replicated in independent investigations\\nby different teams of investigators.Multiple genetic loci are likely to underlie the heritability of\\nthe complex phenotype of athletic performance.Some aspects\\nof this phenotype have high estimated heritability, for example,\\nthe heritability of maximal O2 uptake (V˙O2max)i s /H1101150% in\\nboth the sedentary state and after training (3, 4).Even if\\nheritability is less for other aspects of athletic performance,\\neach genetic variant is likely to explain only a small fraction of\\nthe genetic predisposition.\\n</SENT 01_06>\\n<SENT 01_07>\\nRecently, Williams and Folland (44)\\ncalculated the probability that exists for an individual to be in\\npossession of any of the most optimal of the 23 selected\\npolymorphisms related to athletic performance.Studies investigating the collective influence of a number of genetic polymorphisms could possibly help unravel and thus possibly better\\nexplain the inherent individual variations in athletic performance.In the present study, we studied participants in the\\nOlympus Marathon, an athletic event that requires considerable\\nendurance and for which there are large differences in performance among the participants.The optimal physiological phenotype of athletes competing in long-duration events probably\\nentails an inherent genetic makeup conferring cardiovascular,\\npulmonary, and skeletal competence to perform during such\\nevents and efficient metabolism of available substrates to\\nsustain the performance throughout the event’s duration.\\n</SENT 01_07>\\n<SENT 01_08>\\nWe evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\\neight genes that have known functional roles, and we based our\\nselection on previous gene association studies investigating\\naspects of athletic endurance.In particular, the selected genes\\nin our study have been previously associated with appropriate\\nsubstrate metabolism as a source of energy during exercise, in the\\ncardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise that would\\nallow for a much efficient O2 uptake and transfer to the muscles\\nfor utilization, and/or in muscle contractility suitable for the\\npurposes of endurance performance.\\n</SENT 01_08>\\n<SENT 01_09>\\nMoreover, the selected\\npolymorphisms had been evaluated in the past in one or more\\nstudies, where at least one of the studies had reported significant associations with endurance performance (5, 27).METHODS\\nCohort participants.We enrolled athletes participated in the annual\\nOlympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece.We only\\nenrolled athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry to avoid confounding\\ndata from population stratification.Athletes were approached at the\\ncompetition site during the 2 days before the race by a member of\\nthe research team.\\n</SENT 01_09>\\n<SENT 01_10>\\nThey were informed about the aim and purpose of\\nthe study and were asked whether or not they would be interested in\\nparticipating in the study.Written informed consent was obtained\\nAddress for reprint requests and other correspondence: J.

the Oragene collection\\ntube also contained 2 ml of stabilizing agent.All samples were\\ncollected at the competition site in Greece and were then sent for\\nanalysis at Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).Samples were processed using a PUREGENE DNA Purification kit (DNA Genotek’s Oragene DNA Purification protocol, DNA\\nGenotec, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\\n</SENT 02_03>\\n<SENT 02_04>\\nFor DNA isolation, 3 ml of the\\nsaliva mixture were used, and 120 ml of Oragene purifier were added.After a 10-min incubation on ice, the vial was spun down, and the\\npellet was discarded.Subsequently, an equal volume of ethanol was\\nadded to precipitate the DNA.After a 10-min incubation at room\\ntemperature, the vial was spun down, the supernatant was discarded,\\nand the pellet was air dried.The DNA pellet was then dissolved in 300\\nml MilliQ water.Polymorphisms under study.The selected genes, their respective\\nSNP identification numbers, and the implicated function of these\\ngenes are shown in Table 1.For all genes under study, one variant has\\nbeen investigated for associations with endurance performance and\\nrelated phenotypes except for the peroxisome proliferator-activated\\nreceptor (PPAR)-/H9254gene ( PPARD), where three variants have been\\nproposed to affect endurance.\\n</SENT 02_04>\\n<SENT 02_05>\\nFor all SNPs, Taqman assays were\\ngenerated and applied according to the manufacturers’s specifications.Results were analyzed with the ABI Taqman 7900HT using sequence\\ndetection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\\nCA).To confirm the accuracy of the genotyping results, 5% of the\\nrandomly selected samples were regenotyped with the same method.No inconsistencies were observed.All primers and probes used in the\\npresent study are available on request.Phenotypes.We defined a priori the following phenotypes: 1) the\\nevent completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the\\nathlete was enrolled in the study,2) the fastest reported event\\ncompletion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race, and\\n3) how many kilometers per week the athlete ran during the 12 mo\\nbefore enrollment in the study.For athletes who ran both years and were included in our sample\\nsize, we used for the time to finish the time in the year during which\\nthey were first enrolled.\\n</SENT 02_05>\\n<SENT 02_06>\\nHowever, if they only completed one of the\\ntwo races, then we used the time when they completed the race.All\\nathletes that exceeded the time limit for finishing the race set by the\\norganizing committee (12 h in 2007 and 10 h in 2008) were personally\\ncontacted to provide a self-reported time finish, since the official time\\nwas not available.Statistical analyses.Genotypes for each tested polymorphism were\\ntested for compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\\nlaw using an exact test.Deviations from HWE may be due to different\\nreasons (31), but, in this design, they may also be used as a crude test\\nof association (36), since the analyzed cohort is a selected population\\nTable 1.\\n</SENT 02_06>\\n<SENT 02_07>\\nPolymorphisms under study\\nGene Name Major Role rs Number(s) Genotypes, number (%)\\nACTN3 /H92513-Actinin Skeletal muscle component rs1815739 CT: 214 (48.9) CC: 132 (30.1) TT: 85 (19.4) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\\nAMPD1 AMP deaminase-1 Skeletal muscle metabolism rs17602729 GG: 336 (76.7) AG: 93 (21.2) AA: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\\nBDKRB2 Bradykinin B2 receptor Bradykinin receptor rs1799722 CC: 169 (38.6) CT: 183 (41.8) TT: 80 (18.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\\nADRB2 /H92522-Adrenergic receptor Adrenergic receptor rs1042713 GG: 165 (37.7) GA: 207 (47.3) AA: 60 (13.7) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)\\nPPARGC1A PPAR coactivator-1/H9251Regulation of energy\\nmetabolism genes\\nrs8192678 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.1)\\nPPARA PPAR-/H9251/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs4253778 GG: 284 (64.8) GC: 135 (30.8) CC: 15 (3.4) Undetermined: 4 (0.9)\\nPPARD PPAR-/H9254/H9252 -Oxidation of fatty acids rs6902123 TT: 351 (80.1) TC: 78 (17.8) CC: 2 (0.5) Undetermined: 7 (1.6)\\nrs1053049 TT: 221 (50.5) CT: 188 (42.9) CC: 23 (5.3) Undetermined: 6 (1.4)rs2267668 AA: 297 (67.8) GA: 119 (27.2) GG: 17 (3.9) Undetermined: 5 (1.4)\\nAPOE Apolipoprotein E Binding and catabolism of\\nlipoproteins\\nrs7412 and rs429358 other/other: 366 (83.5) ε4/other: 59 (13.5) ε4/ ε4: 4 (0.9) Undetermined: 9 (2.1)\\nPPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.For APOE, the two polymorphisms are linked and define six possible genotypes ( ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3, ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4, and ε2/ε4).568 POLYMORPHISMS IN OLYMPUS MARATHON RUNNERS\\nJ Appl Physiol VOL 108  MARCH 2010  www.jap.org\\nDownloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jappl (110.138.091.074) on January 26, 2023.\\n</SENT 02_07>\\n   \n",

however, we also performed a\\nsensitivity analysis where the timing of such dropout athletes was\\nimputed by the time of the slowest athlete finishing the race.\\n</SENT 03_03>\\n<SENT 03_04>\\nFinally,\\nin another analysis, we tested if a specific variant affected the\\nperformance of an athlete by testing athletes that finished the race\\nversus athletes who did not complete the event using a per-allele\\nmodel.Our study had 80% power to detect at /H9251/H110050.05 associations where\\nthe per-allele effect would be 1/10th the magnitude of the standard\\ndeviation of the phenotype of interest in the population, when the\\nminor allele frequency would be 10%.\\n</SENT 03_04>\\n<SENT 03_05>\\nAssociations that reach formal statistical significance at P /H110210.05\\ndo not necessarily mean that they are true.One may consider an\\napproach to correct theP values for eight genes being evaluated and\\nclaim significance for P /H110210.05/8 /H110050.006 or, if all variants are\\nconsidered independent, for P /H110210.05/11 /H110050.0045.However, such a\\ncorrection would be debatable given that these gene variants have\\nalready been proposed and have at least one other study suggesting\\nthat they may be important.To avoid this controversy, we present\\ninferences based on an alternative, Bayesian approach.\\n</SENT 03_05>\\n<SENT 03_06>\\nSpecifically,\\nwe estimated the Bayes factors according to a spike and smear model\\n(10), if the mean effect of true associations might be 0.04 in the log\\nscale (corresponding to a 9.6% difference in performance per allele,\\ne.g., completing the marathon in 456 vs. 500 min).The inverse of\\nthe Bayes factor tells how many fold the odds of an association to be\\ntrue increase based on the results of the study compared with what one\\nthought before the study.\\n</SENT 03_06>\\n<SENT 03_07>\\nThus, if the odds of an association to be true\\nwere 1:9 [1/(1 /H110019) /H110051/10 /H1100510% likely to be true] before the study\\nand the Bayes factor from the study data is 0.2 (inverse /H110051/0.2 /H110055),\\nthen the odds of the association to be true become 5:9 [5/(5 /H110019) /H11005\\n5/14 /H1100536% likely to be true].Given that different investigators may\\nhave different beliefs, we also present credibility estimates (the\\nlikelihood of an association being true) for prior evidence of 0.1 (with\\na 1:10 prior chance of the association being true), 0.001 (a more\\nconservative, sceptical approach, with a 1:1,000 chance of the association being true), and 0.000001 (a most sceptical approach, with a 1\\nin a million chance of the association being true, e.g., if the prior\\nevidence mostly suggests that the association would have an effect in\\nthe opposite direction than what is seen in the present study).\\n</SENT 03_07>\\n<SENT 03_08>\\nAll analyses were performed with STATA (version 10.0, College\\nStation, TX).P values were two tailed.Reporting of the study data\\nfollows STREGA guidelines (17).RESULTS\\nCohort characteristics.A total of 438 athletes (417 men and\\n21 women) volunteered for the study during the 2 yr.

polymorphism has been\\ninvestigated in many phenotypes, with some evidence oflower\\nmean arterial blood pressure at rest, during and after exercise for\\nArg16 homozygotes (37), decreased exercise performance in\\npatients with heart failure with Gly16 (42), and decreased thermogenic responses to/H92522-adrenergic stimulation with Arg16 (26).\\n</SENT 06_01>\\n<SENT 06_02>\\nAMPD1 (rs17602729), which functions in skeletal muscle\\nmetabolism (salvage of adenine nucleotides) and is involved in\\nthe regulation of muscle glycolysis during rigorous exercise\\n(29), was evaluated in a case-control study (n /H11005104 endurance\\nathletes vs. 100 controls).The minor (A) allele was actually\\nsignificantly less common in endurance athletes than in controls, but endurance indexes such as V˙O2max, ventilatory threshold, and respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between athlete carriers and noncarriers of the\\nminor allele (29).\\n</SENT 06_02>\\n<SENT 06_03>\\nFurthermore,AMPD1 rs17602729 was evaluated in a study assessing physiological responses in 503\\nindividuals undergoing a 20-wk training regime, and the minor\\nallele had smaller ventilatory training responses pertaining to\\nendurance (28).Therefore, our results are in the opposite\\ndirection for this polymorphism than what prior studies had\\nsuggested.Discrepancies may be due to different study design,\\nsetting, types of athletes, and phenotype definitions, but most\\nlikely they simply represent false positives in opposite directions, and this polymorphism is not credibly associated with\\nendurance performance.Incidentally, there is a case report (19)\\non a world-class athlete with exceptionally favorable laboratory indexes for endurance performance (V˙O2max) despite car rying the A allele (19), which further documents that these\\ngenetic effects, even if present, are subtle and do not doom\\none’s athletic performance.\\n</SENT 06_03>\\n<SENT 06_04>\\nVariation at the BDKRB2 (rs1799722) gene locus, which\\nencodes a receptor for bradykinin and is implicated in the\\nincrease of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise\\n(34), has also been associated with endurance performance in\\nprevious studies.In one study (43), athletes (n /H1100581) competing in longer distance events had a significantly higher frequency of the/H110029 allele, a 9-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 1.In a study of 453 athletes who completed the\\nSouth Africa Ironman Triathlon, the athletes had a significantly\\nhigher frequency of the/H110029//H110029 genotype compared with the\\ncontrols (n /H11005203) (34).In that same study (34), the /H110029 allele\\nwas not significantly different in three groups of athletes who\\ncompleted the event in fast, medium, and slow times (34).\\n</SENT 06_04>\\n<SENT 06_05>\\nThe\\n/H110029 allele has been demonstrated to result in increased transcription rates of the gene (6).In our study, we focused only on\\nSNPs rather than insertion/deletion polymorphisms, and we\\ninstead genotyped the promoter variant rs1799722 (also known\\nas/H1100258C/T), which is also known to have a functional impact\\non the gene, with increased transcription rates for the T allele\\nin luciferase experiments (15).We found results consistent\\nwith previous evidence: the high transcription allele was overrepresented in this group of endurance athletes and, even more\\nso, among those who are habitual runners.The same promoter\\nvariant has also been associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and baroreflex sensitivity (7, 22).\\n</SENT 06_05>\\n<SENT 06_06>\\nAll of the other polymorphisms that showed no nominally\\nsignificant signals in our study have been examined in the past\\nin at least one other study, but the evidence was often inconclusive or may be stronger for associations with phenotypes\\nthat have only indirect bearing on athletic endurance performance.Moreover, we only examined specific polymorphisms\\nfor each one of these genes, so we cannot exclude that other\\nvariants in the same gene locus may have an effect on athletic\\nperformance in particular populations.\\n</SENT 06_06>\\n<SENT 06_07>\\nFinally, our study was\\npowered to detect modest effects, but subtle effects for variants\\nwith minor allele frequencies/H1102110% may have been missed.Specifically, in /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which\\ncodes for the synthesis of actinin-3 (a major skeletal muscle\\nconstituent) and is implicated in fast contraction ability by\\nmuscles (46), the T allele was reported at somewhat higher\\nfrequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies\\n(25, 46), but the differences were not formally significant.\\n</SENT 06_07>\\n<SENT 06_08>\\nMoreover, rs1815739 was not associated with a continuous\\nendurance outcome (based on competitor finish time) during\\nthe South Africa Éronman Triathlon competition (n /H11005457\\nathletes vs. 143 controls) (33), and no differences were observed in a case-control study (18) (n /H1100552 Olympic-level\\nrunners vs. 50 professional cyclists vs. 123 controls)

(11) may also be\\nimportant in athletic performance.PPARD (rs1053049, rs6902123, and rs2267668) is involved\\nin fatty acid /H9252-oxidation, glucose utilization, mitochondrial\\nbiogenesis,

= 1.42, CI [1.13-1.79]), which was correlated with BMI correlations.However, active exercise by subjects carrying the same genotype reduced\\nthe risk of obesity by nearly 2-fold (OR = 0.62, CI [0.25-0.84]).In contrast, TT\\ngenotype was not statistically significant in reducing the risk of obesity in the\\nactive exercise group.Conclusions: Our results support a previous finding correlating FTO and\\nobesity-related traits and suggest that the interaction with genetic variation\\nand physical activity is an important risk factor for obesity.1 | INTRODUCTION\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the\\nprevalence of obesity worldwide has nearly tripled since\\n1975, and more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and\\nover (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight in\\n2016.\\n</SENT 09_03>\\n<SENT 09_04>\\nAccording to the key facts reported by WHO, most\\nof the world's population lives in countries where overweight and obesity kill more people than underweight\\n(World Health Organization, 2018).Obesity and\\noverweight are attributed to an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many\\nforms of work, changing modes of transportation, and\\nincreasing urbanization.Obesity is becoming a global\\npublic health concern as a result of low physical activity\\nand genetic predisposition in individuals of all ages and\\nethnic groups, as it contributes to the increasing burden\\nof cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Kim\\net al., 2016; Ogden et al., 2006).Genetic variants of the FTO (fat mass and obesity\\nassociated) gene, located on chromosome 16q12.2, are\\ncorrelated with obesity and higher body mass indexHye-Won Cho and Hyun-Seok Jin contributed equally to this study.Received: 12

2014).Heritability estimates for obesityrelated traits indicate that a substantial proportion of\\nphenotypic variation still needs to be explained\\n(O'Rahilly & Farooqi, 2008).It is proposed that the interaction between FTO gene and lifestyle factors may contribute to the variability of those traits, since many\\nstudies have shown controversial results or negligible\\ninteractive effects.Previous studies have demonstrated a link between\\nFTO and higher BMI in humans.\\n</SENT 10_01>\\n<SENT 10_02>\\nIndividuals with first\\nintron rs9939609 FTO obesity-risk allele (homozygous = AA and heterozygous = AT) were found to\\nexhibit higher BMI than those with wild-type alleles\\n(TT) (Qi et al., 2014; Saber-Ayad et al., 2019).Recent\\nstudies reported an interaction betweenFTO genotypes,\\nphysical inactivity, and BMI (Leonska-Duniec\\net al., 2018; Liaw, Liaw, & Lan, 2019).Higher levels of\\nphysical activity reduced the likelihood of being overweight or obese (Bernstein, Costanza, & Morabia, 2004;\\nKing et al., 2001; Payne, Cahill, Sun, Loredo-Osti, &\\nAbarin, 2014; Yoshioka et al., 2005).However, none of\\nthese studies considered the effect of genetic factors as\\nmodifiers.\\n</SENT 10_02>\\n<SENT 10_03>\\nPhysical activity has been thought to exacerbate the effect of theFTO gene (Andreasen et al., 2008).The effect of genetic susceptibility on obesity caused by\\nFTO variants can actually be attenuated by increased\\nphysical activity (Vimaleswaran et al., 2009).A replication study is essential to establish the\\nreported genetic association, especially among\\npopulations of different ethnic backgrounds.However,\\nstudies involving Oceanic population (Ohashi\\net al., 2007), African Americans (Hinney et al., 2007),\\nHan Chinese (Li et al., 2008), and Japanese (Horikoshi\\net al., 2007) failed to detect the association between previously reported SNPs and obesity or obesity-related traits\\n(Chang et al., 2008).\\n</SENT 10_03>\\n<SENT 10_04>\\nAlthough the limited sample size\\nand power of these studies is the most likely reason for\\nthe lack of association, evidence showed that otherFTO\\nSNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs9939609\\nmay be causative variants in non-European populations\\n(Grant et al., 2008).Taken together, the significant role\\nplayed by physical activity in the relation betweenFTO\\ngenetic variant and obesity across different cultures or\\nethnicities needs to be established.\\n</SENT 10_04>\\n<SENT 10_05>\\nAlthoughFTO genotypes have been reported to interact with physical activity\\nand correlate with BMI (Lee et al., 2010), the direct effect\\nof the risk alleles in theFTO gene and physical activity\\non obesity have yet to be reported in the Korean\\npopulation.Although physical activity has been shown to facilitate weight loss and weight maintenance in obese\\nsubjects, a tremendous interindividual variation exists\\n(Perusse et al., 2000).It is unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, attenuate obesity in individuals with an underlyingFTO genetic predisposition.Thus, the objective of this study was to further\\nexplore the relationships between physical activity,FTO\\nSNPs, and obesity within a Korean population.\\n</SENT 10_05>\\n<SENT 10_06>\\nWe\\nbelieve that our results pertaining to obesity and physical\\nactivity are important and widely applicable to the obesity health promotion program.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n2.1 | Subjects\\nA total of 8840 subjects aged 40 to 69 years were recruited\\nfrom the Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean\\nGenome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), which represent rural and urban communities in Korea, respectively.The baseline survey of the KoGES involved a total of\\n10 038 adults from 2001 to 2002, surveyed biannually.The Korea Association Resource (KARE) project facilitated the availability of DNA in the large-scale genomewide analysis of 10 004 participants, following which\\n8840 genotypes were released into the public domain\\n(Lee et al., 2010).\\n</SENT 10_06>\\n<SENT 10_07>\\nA detailed analysis of Ansung and\\nAnsan cohorts has been published previously (Cho\\net al., 2007).The participant survey involved not only\\ntheir parents' health history and anthropometric data\\nsuch as height, weight, and waist and hip circumference,\\nbut also education and income, physical activity, and dietary intake.We categorized the participants as nonobese\\n(18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (30 kg/m2 ≤ BMI).We\\nfollowed the WHO cutoffs to delineate obesity (BMI of\\n25.0-29.99 for overweight [preobesity] and≥30.0 for obesity) (World Health Organization, 2000).\\n</SENT 10_07>\\n<SENT 10_08>\\nThe genetic\\ninformation used in this study was distributed by the\\nHuman Resources Bank of Korea Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention (KBN-2017-046) and analyzed\\nafter approval of the research ethics committee of the\\nKorea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and Hoeso\\nUniversity (1041231170418-HR-056-02).Written informed\\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.2.2 | Anthropometry and

Associations of polymorphisms of eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners. J Appl Physiol. 2010;108(3):567-574., The athletes were recruited by approaching them at the competition site during the 2 days before the race, which took place at the annual Olympus Marathon event set on Mount Olympus in Greece. The inclusion criteria specified that only athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry were included to avoid confounding data from population stratification. A total of 438 athletes who participated in the 2007 and 2008 annual running events of the Olympus Marathon were enrolled in the study. (01_09), 1. Phenotype of interest: Event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study.\\nThis phenotype was directly measured or timed, as stated in SENT 02_05: \"the event completion time at the specific Olympus Marathon where the athlete was enrolled in the study\".\\n\\n2. Phenotype of interest: Fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race.\\nThis phenotype was either measured directly or self-reported when the individual exceeded the time limit for finish and the official time was not available, as cited in the same SENT 02_05: \"the fastest reported event completion time ever achieved in the Olympus Marathon race\".\\n\\n3. Phenotype of interest: Number of kilometers run per week during the 12 months before enrollment in the study.\\nThis phenotype was self-reported based upon the participants' recollection, as referred in SENT 02_01: \"how many kilometers they had run per week in the last week, month, and year before the competition\"., In the study, only two polymorphisms showed nominally significant associations with any of the three phenotypes. These polymorphisms are:\\n\\n1. BDKRB2 rs1799722 (ID: 01_03): This polymorphism had a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.018 for the overall cohort of male athletes and P < 0.006 when limited to 316 habitual male runners) with an excess of the TT genotype. However, there were no significant associations reported for this polymorphism with the three phenotypes of interest: competitive event time, fastest time ever, and kilometers run per week.\\n\\n2. ADRB2 rs1042713 (ID: 01_04): When limited to 316 male athletes who identified running as their preferred sport, this polymorphism had nominally significant associations with faster times for the minor (A) allele for the fastest time ever (P < 0.01).\\n\\nThe direction of effect for both BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2 rs1042713 was identical as previously postulated, indicating consistency. The study concluded that BDKRB2 rs1799722 and ADRB2 rs1042713 have some support for being implicated in endurance performance among habitual runners and require further investigation., The researchers accounted for potential confounding factors such as population stratification by enrolling only athletes of self-verified Greek ancestry. This method helps mitigate the effects of population stratification as they're dealing with a more homogeneous group of individuals with a shared genetic background. (SENT 01_09) Additionally, all statistical analyses were done within this specific Greek population, further controlling for potential confounding factors due to population stratification.]   \n",

This phenotype was chosen as it reflects overall endurance performance, which is an area of high interest in both sports and genetics research. By selecting endurance athletes who have participated in a particularly demanding event, the study intends to identify genetic variants associated with endurance performance. These genetic markers might provide insights into an athlete's ability to endure prolonged physical activities. The study aims to understand how genetic factors contribute to the observed variance in human athletic capabilities., The major and minor alleles for each gene variant were determined based on their frequency in the study population. The allele with the highest frequency is considered the major allele, while the allele with the lowest frequency is the minor allele. This identification is typically done based on the raw genotype data obtained from the study participants.\\n\\nIn the context provided, this determination is likely based on the genotype frequencies presented in Table 1. (03_01) For instance, if we look at the ADRB2 rs1042713 variant, the G allele appears to be the major allele with a frequency of 0.78, while the A allele is the minor allele with a frequency of 0.22. This convention allows for a consistent method of defining alleles in genetic studies, thereby enabling comparisons across different research studies., To answer this, we need to look into the genotype frequencies of male and female athletes separately:\\n\\n<SENT 03_09>\\nThe distribution of alleles and genotypes.The frequencies of the\\npolymorphisms are shown in Table 1.\\n</SENT 03_09>\\n\\nUnfortunately, no information on genotype frequencies for male and female athletes separately is explicitly provided in the given text. However, we are presented with the overall population characteristics:\\n\\n<SENT 03_08>\\nA total of 438 athletes (417 men and\\n21 women) volunteered for the study during the 2 yr. Two\\nhundred sixty-eight athletes enrolled in 2007 and 229 athletes\\ncompleted the race; in 2008, 170 athletes enrolled and 156\\nathletes finished the race.Nine athletes who did not finish the\\nrace in the year of enrolment (2007) completed the race in\\n2008.Hence, there were 44 athletes that did not ever finish the\\nOlympus marathon.Population characteristics are shown in\\nTable 2.\\n</SENT 03_08>\\n\\nGiven this information, we can assume that the frequencies of genotypes presented in Table 1 are derived from a total of 417 men and 21 women (the number of athletes per sex who volunteered).\\n\\nHowever, without direct data comparison on the genotype distribution between male and female athletes, we can't definitively conclude whether specific significant differences exist between these groups. Checking HWE and validating the distribution of genotypes in relation to male and female athletes might be needed to make a concretely accurate comparison. \\n\\nIn most genetic association studies, it is common to perform the analysis stratified by sex in order to consider possible differences between the two groups. The absence of such an analysis in the provided text suggests that no significant difference in genotype distribution might have been discovered in this particular study. However, the exact conclusion can not be drawn without explicit mention of it. This is important to note as it emphasizes the importance of gender-specific analyses in genetic research.\\n\\nRemember that the absence of information in one study does not negate the existence of these differences. It just means that they weren't found in this particular analysis., In the study context, the athletes' training volume was not consistently integrated into the initial association analyses. As per the information provided in ID: <SENT 03_02> and ID: <SENT 03_03>, the phenotypes were adjusted for age and year of the race, considering the possible impact of varying weather conditions in different years. However, the training volume data, which is the number of kilometers each athlete ran per week, was not explicitly mentioned as being incorporated into the main association analyses. \\n\\nNonetheless, in a secondary analysis on athletes who stated that running was their preferred sport, a sensitivity analysis was performed where the training volume was used as a covariate, and the association results for ADRB2 rs1042713 remained significant (ID: <SENT 04_03>). This suggests that the training volume can impact the association findings, although it was not a primary aspect factored into most of the association analyses described in the context. Therefore, more explicit inclusion of the training volume as a covariate might yield different or more significant results. The study could have potentially considered it from the beginning, especially given its direct relevance to athletic performance. \\n\\nRemember, scientific research often involves iterations and refinements, including the addition or modification of variables in analyses based on insights from initial results or domain knowledge. The integration of the training volume in the sensitivity analysis provides a good example of this scientific process., In the study, there are no detailed results presented regarding the pairwise interaction analysis of the significant SNPs. Therefore, it's unclear if there were any significant findings in this regard. However, you can notice from ID: [04_04], which states, \"Moreover, a secondary analysis, a pairwise interaction analysis of the significant SNPs did not provide any significant findings (not shown in detail).\" This suggests that there were no significant findings in the pairwise interaction analysis, but this doesn't provide details about which specific SNPs it was performed on. For the full details of how the authors performed these analyses, it would be necessary to refer to the original study.]   \n",
       "2  [ADRB2 rs1042713 is a genetic variant in the gene encoding the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), specifically at the amino acid position 16. This variant produces a change from arginine (Arg) to glycine (Gly), which is generally referred to as the Arg16Gly polymorphism. The functional role of ADRB2 rs1042713 in the human body is associated with the activity of the β2-adrenergic receptor, which is a cell surface protein primarily responsible for bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodilation.\\n\\nIn the muscular and respiratory systems, the β2-adrenergic receptor plays a critical role in response to adrenaline, a hormone released during exercise. The receptor regulates airway smooth muscle relaxation and contractile properties, as well as cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise.\\n\\nIndividuals with the Arg16 variant generally have a higher receptor density and increased intrinsic efficacy, which can lead to a heightened fight-or-flight response, potentially affecting their ability to respond to exercise and stress. However, it doesn't guarantee athletic success, as other genes, environmental factors, and training play a significant role in athleticism.\\n\\nMoreover, while ADRB2 rs1042713 might subtly influence athletic performance through its effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise, clear associations between this genetic variant and endurance performance remain modest (SENT 05_03)., The AMPD1 rs17602729 polymorphism affects skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise by influencing the function of adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 (AMPD1). This gene is responsible for the salvage of adenine nucleotides and plays a role in the regulation of muscle glycolysis during intensive exercise. The polymorphism results in a change from cytosine (C) to guanine (G), leading to a coding change from a glutamine to a stop codon at amino acid residue 255. This truncation causes the absence or reduction of AMPD1 enzymatic activity in muscle cells.\\n\\nCarriers of the nonfunctional allele have reduced or absent AMPD1 enzyme activity in their skeletal muscles, which can impair the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the glycolytic pathway. During intense exercise, the reliance on glycolytic processes increases, and reduced AMPD1 activity could disrupt the balance of adenine nucleotides, leading to premature fatigue or reduced exercise performance. (06_02)\\n\\nHowever, in the context of the study you provided (05_01 to 05_04 and 06_01 to 06_11), the AMPD1 rs17602729 polymorphism showed no nominally significant signals in relation to endurance performance among runners. Therefore, while AMPD1 rs17602729 may influence skeletal muscle metabolism during rigorous exercise on a molecular level, the association with endurance performance appears to be minimal or potentially non-existent. More research is needed to clarify the full impact of this polymorphism in athletic performance., There could be several reasons for these discrepancies between our study and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 and its association with endurance performance. These reasons include, but are not limited to:\\n\\n1. Differences in Study Design: Different studies may use different methodologies, sample sizes, and athlete types, which could lead to different results. For example, our study focused on a specific athletic event and a selected group of athletes, while other studies might have used different populations or examined multiple endurance sports. (Details in SENT 05_03 and SENT 06_03)\\n2. Genetic Heterogeneity: Genetic effects can vary across populations and ethnicities due to differences in allele frequencies, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions. Thus, the results of the current study may not be directly comparable to previous studies conducted in different populations or ethnic groups.\\n3. Context-Specific Effects: The effect of a particular gene variant on endurance performance might be context-specific, i.e., dependent on the specific endurance sport or event. As such, the discrepancy between different studies might be due to differences in the type of endurance event being considered.\\n4. Lack of Replication: Some genetic association studies may not have been replicated or validated in independent studies, making it difficult to conclude whether the associations are real or due to chance.\\n5. Inconclusive Evidence: Some studies might have shown no significant associations between a gene variant and endurance performance, but their results may not have been strong enough to rule out the possibility of a modest effect. This could lead to mixed results across different studies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the discrepancies between our study's results and previous studies regarding AMPD1 rs17602729 could be due to various factors. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between genetics and athletic performance in different contexts and populations. (SENT 06_03), The BDKRB2 gene encodes for the bradykinin receptor B2, which plays a role in the increase of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise. The promoter variant rs1799722 (C/T, also known as -58T/C) affects the regulation of BDKRB2's expression.\\n\\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that the T allele of the rs1799722 variant leads to increased transcription rates for the BDKRB2 gene. This is often due to a change in the binding affinity of certain transcription factors or alterations of the overall structure of the promoter region. A study cited in the context (SENT 06_05) notes that the T allele leads to increased transcription rates in luciferase experiments.\\n\\nIn summary, the functional impact of the BDKRB2 rs1799722 promoter variant involves an alteration in the regulation of the BDKRB2 gene's expression. This modification, specifically the T allele, is associated with increased gene transcription.\\n\\nThe provided context does not specify the exact transcription factors involved or how they might be affected by this variant. Further research or studies in this area could provide a clearer understanding of the accurate transcription factors involved., Ancestry-specific genetic effects may influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance due to the differing frequencies of genetic variants across populations. Some gene variants, which can impact athletic performance, may be more common in particular populations, such as those with a long history of specific physical activities. This could result in a stronger association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance in those populations.\\n\\nFor example, in the case of /H92513-actinin ( ACTN3; rs1815739), which has been implicated in fast contraction ability by muscles, the T allele was reported at somewhat higher frequencies in endurance athletes than controls in two studies, but only in Caucasian populations (25, 46). If these variants are also common in specific ancestral populations, it could result in a stronger genetic effect on athletic performance for those populations compared to others where the functional variants may be less prevalent. In addition, gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions may also differ across ancestral populations, impacting how these polymorphisms affect athletic performance in various groups.\\n\\nIn summary, ancestry-specific genetic effects can influence the association between certain polymorphisms and athletic performance by varying the frequency of functional variants and modulating gene-gene or gene-environment interactions across different populations.

However, it's clear that the context revolves around the investigation of genetic factors that may influence endurance performance in general. To get the specifics of exercise training methods, more data or inquiries regarding the study being discussed would be necessary., The genetic variants investigated in the study, primarily those in the ACTN3 rs1815739, AMPD1 rs17602729, and PPARGC1A rs8192678 genes, are believed to potentially influence endurance performance due to their roles in muscle composition, energy production, and mitochondrial function.\\n\\n1. ACTN3 rs1815739: This gene codes for alpha-actinin-3, a protein that is highly expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers and is crucial for their structure and function. A variant of this gene, R577X, leads to a loss of alpha-actinin-3, which is more common in endurance athletes, suggesting that individuals without this protein may be better suited for endurance-based sports (Yang et al., 2003 [SENT 08_10]).\\n\\n2. AMPD1 rs17602729: AMPD1 encodes an enzyme that plays a role in adenosine monophosphate metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining a balance of energy in muscles during intense exercise. The C34T variant results in a less efficient version of the enzyme, and this has been hypothesized to increase the energy reserves in type I (slow-twitch, primarily used in endurance activities) muscle fibers (Rico-Sanz et al., 2003 [SENT 28]; Ruiz et al., 2005 [SENT 08_05]; Niemi et al., 2005 [SENT 25]).\\n\\n3. PPARGC1A rs8192678: The PPARGC1A gene encodes a transcriptional coactivator that plays a critical role in mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation of metabolism, which are essential for endurance performance. The Gly482Ser variant is associated with altered gene expression and mitochondrial function, which in turn can influence an individual's ability to perform aerobic exercises (Lucia et al., 2005 [SENT 08_02]).\\n\\nIn summary, these genetic variants potentially affect endurance performance by influencing muscle composition, energy production, and mitochondrial function. However, it is essential to note that genetics alone does not determine athletic ability; environmental factors, including training and opportunities, also play significant roles in athletic performance., To answer this, we need to refer back to SENT 07_02:\\n\\nThe first study mentioned in the context is (30), where n is given as H1100539, which is world-level athletes vs. 15 national-level athletes. The second study is (32), with n: H1100546, which is endurance athletes vs. 123 controls. And in the third study (23), the sample size is given as H1100550, including professional cyclists vs. 52 Olympic-level runners vs. 39 world-level rowers vs. 123 controls.\\n\\nSo, the sample sizes for these three studies are 15, 123, 52, 39, and 123 respectively. However, some of these numbers including professional cyclists, Olympic-level runners, and world-level rowers are from different groups compared in the study, not just two groups as in the first two studies. So, the actual sizes of case and control groups are 15 vs. 15 (world-class athletes in the first study), and roughly 123 vs. 123 (athletes and controls in the second study), where controls might be slightly more in number since they belong to the general population. \\n\\nBut without more context about the study design, these numbers only give a vague idea of the real sample size in the case and control groups. This mathematical analysis would need to be complemented by further information about how subjects were distributed within and between these groups. The three case-control studies included varying representation of athletes and controls, which would make it difficult to draw direct comparisons without more specifics about their methodologies., The limitations of using a cohort design without a comparison against matched non-athlete controls mainly stem from the lack of a clear baseline for the genetic associations being investigated. When only examining athletes, it becomes challenging to differentiate between the genetic variations that may contribute specifically to athletic performance and those that are simply common in the general population. This is particularly relevant when looking at the allele frequencies in the sample of athletes compared to the population at large.\\n\\nAdditionally, this approach fails to account for the potential impact of environmental factors that may also contribute to athletic performance, such as access to training facilities or nutrition. These factors could affect the allele frequencies observed in the athlete population, making it difficult to attribute any observed differences entirely to genetics.\\n\\nWe can represent this point scientifically based on SENT 07_03:\\n\"We used a cohort design and did not make a comparison against matched nonathlete controls from the general population.Therefore, we performed two analyses for association: a first crude screening based on the Hardy-Weinberg test and another based on association for continuous outcomes of endurance performance within the cohort of athletes. Hardy-Weinberg testing has low power as an association test, and subtle associations may have been missed in this screening. The analysis of comparative performance is based on a continuous outcome, and it has good power to detect modest differences, but most genetic effects for common variants represent effects with very subtle magnitude (13), and such effects could still have been missed.\"\\n\\nTo put it in simpler terms, studying just athletes limits our ability to understand how much of the genetic differences we observe are actually related to athletic performance, rather than other factors., The Hardy-Weinberg test's low power as an association test means that it may not effectively detect subtle genetic associations in the study. Despite its benefits in screening for such associations (SENT 07_03), the limitations in using this test as an association test may lead to missed effects, some of which could contribute significantly to human physical performance and athletic potential. For instance, it might overlook effects of certain genes or polymorphisms that play a role in determining one's ability to perform in endurance activities. Hence, the findings of the study could be limited, and further testing through different methods could be worthwhile to confirm or disprove the existing findings. (07_03)]   \n",

This information is crucial as it can provide an understanding of the intensity and nature of the physical activities that contributed to a reduced risk of obesity. For a more detailed understanding of the activities, it may be helpful to refer to other studies or specific guidelines for categorizing physical activities.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or details.\\nHere is the reference: <SENT 09_02>\\nPhysical activity was defined as 3 hours or more of daily intense activity.\\n</SENT 09_02>, The intensity of physical activity was measured and categorized based on self-reported daily activity obtained from participants' questionnaires (ID: [10_06]). Participants were asked if they performed 3 hours or more of daily intense activity. This threshold was then used to classify subjects into physically active and less active groups. However, note that this self-reporting method likely lacks the precision of more objective measurements, like the use of accelerometers or heart rate monitors. Therefore, it should be interpreted with caution, as it may be subject to recall or response bias. (ID: [10_07]), Based on the provided context, we do not have specific data comparing the association between FTO rs9939609 and obesity in rural vs. urban populations within the Korean population. The context discusses a study conducted on 8840 individuals representing both the rural and urban communities in Korea (Ansung and Ansan cohorts of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study), but there is no explicit comparison of the findings between the two populations. (09_02)\\n\\nTo precisely answer this question, further research should be conducted, focusing on comparing the associations between FTO rs9939609 and obesity in both rural and urban Korean populations. This could involve separate analyses of the Ansung (rural) and Ansan (urban) cohorts and a comparison of the results. Establishing this distinction could potentially provide valuable insights into how genetics and environment interact to affect obesity in different segments of the Korean population. Further context can be found in the original research article provided above., To accurately answer the question, I turned to the provided text for context. I found that the study's information regarding potential confounding factors is not explicitly mentioned. Thus, without additional information about the measures taken by the study to account for these factors and their potential effect on the results, I can't definitively say whether potential confounding factors such as diet and socioeconomic status were controlled for when examining the relationship between physical activity, FTO rs9939609, and obesity. However, a rigorous study would indeed typically attempt to control for these factors to strengthen the findings. (ID: 09_07, 09_03, 09_06), In the study referenced by ID: <09_02>, the authors defined \"active exercise\" as engaging in 3 hours or more of daily intense activity. This criterion was used to categorize study participants in relation to their physical activity levels. The exact nature of the activity was not specified, but it was likely a measure of regular, sustained engagement in vigorous exercise. Further details might be available in the study's methodology, but for the scope of the provided content, 3 hours or more of daily intense activity is the definition of \"active exercise.\"]   \n",
